  "去除无关内容": "你好，欢迎你来到这里。我是李医生，你可以叫我小李。请问怎么称呼你呢？你好，小李。我叫晓华。很高兴认识你，晓华。你今天感觉怎么样？说实话，最近一直感觉不太好，心情很低落。嗯，我能感觉到你的情绪有些沉重。可以和我分享一下发生了什么吗？最近工作压力很大，加上和家人的关系也有些紧张。我觉得自己有点撑不下去了。听起来你同时在面对工作和家庭的压力，这确实不容易。你愿意具体谈谈吗？工作上，领导给了我一个重要的项目，但我总担心自己做不好。回到家，父母又总是对我唠叨，让我觉得很烦躁。你对自己的工作能力有些怀疑，同时家庭的压力也让你感到不安，是这样吗？是的，我总觉得自己不够好，做什么都不顺利。我理解你的感受。这种自我怀疑和压力会让人感到非常疲惫。你平时有做些什么来缓解这些情绪吗？有时候会听听音乐，或者一个人出去走走，但效果不大。保持一些放松的活动是好的开始。你有没有尝试过和朋友或家人聊聊你的感受？我不想让他们担心，而且我觉得他们可能也不理解我。你希望被理解，但又担心表达后会带来更多的困扰，对吗？是的，我不想增加别人的负担。关心他人的感受是很体贴的表现，但你的情绪和感受同样重要。或许我们可以一起寻找一些既能让你表达自己，又不会感到有负担的方式。那该怎么做呢？我们可以从一些小的步骤开始，比如写日记，把自己的情绪记录下来。或者找到一个你信任的人，尝试着分享一点点你的想法。写日记这个方法可以试试。分享的话，我还需要鼓起勇气。这是一个很好的开始。给自己一些时间，不要给自己太大压力。每个人都有自己的节奏。嗯，你说得对。此外，你提到了对自己能力的怀疑。其实，你能够承担重要的项目，说明领导对你是有信心的。但我总害怕辜负他们的期望。害怕失败的感觉是很正常的。但有时候，我们需要认可自己的努力和价值。你已经在为此付出努力了，不是吗？是的，我确实很努力。那么，或许你可以试着肯定自己的付出。每完成一件事情，都给自己一些积极的反馈。我可以试试看。很好。我们的目标是一步一步地改善你的状况。如果你愿意，我们可以在接下来的会面中深入探讨这些问题。好的，谢谢你，今天和你聊完感觉轻松了些。不客气，我很高兴能帮到你。记住，你并不孤单，我们会一起面对这些挑战。谢谢你，小李。不用谢，期待下次见到你。",

Hi. So I understand that you were referred to me by your GP because you\'ve been experiencing some anxiety difficulties. Yeah, um Yeah, I guess it kind of started like five, six years ago. Okay, um It kind of escalated a bit and I\'ve just recently moved out and from living with my parents So it\'s made it a bit worse. I think Okay, is this the first time that you\'ve left home? Yeah, I am Yeah, it\'s the first time actually. Yeah, and I was going to a few years ago. I just thought it\'d be easier to stay home So, okay, so it\'s been quite a big step and a big change and and it sounds like that So that was what led you to go to your GP. Yeah, so how has that changed things for you? Do you know it\'s kind of I haven\'t really told anyone so I mean It\'s made it like better in the sense I feel hopefully this is you know, this is it like it will it\'ll help But I don\'t know. I don\'t like thinking that I\'ve like had to do this I never thought I\'d like be the kind of person who\'d have to actually go and like get help if that makes sense Okay, so how do you feel about being here today? It\'s like scared. I don\'t know. Hopefully it will help. Okay, so you\'ve been feeling a little bit anxious about today. Yeah Okay, so I guess just going back to why you went to the GP and how you\'ve ended up kind of coming here today So it sounds like you\'ve been experiencing anxiety for quite a few years But just recently you moved out of home for the first time and and that was what kind of led you to go to the GP So how did that change things? How were things after you moved out? I thought that they\'d be better but because I thought I\'d have to kind of be independent and it\'s actually a lot worse I\'m just kind of staying in the house a lot. I don\'t really have any friends or anything I mean my family come and visit a bit, but it\'s not I don\'t know It\'s kind of scary because I\'ve just been kind of literally just in the flat by myself Which I always thought I\'d like but I don\'t actually like it Okay, so what other kind of difficulties that you have been experiencing and I mean, I\'m I\'m a photographer and So I kind of it\'s been stopping me a bit my anxiety from being able to get work and Because every time you know, there\'s an opportunity that is kind of involving me having to interact with people I just tend to just turn it down. So it\'s kind of making things hard in that respect and Just kind of friends wise and everything. I just feel like I\'m just kind of increasingly more alone So it\'s kind of stopping me from making friends and you know, like relationships and stuff Okay, so you said that Your difficulties are getting in the way of you doing certain things So they\'re they\'re stopping you from taking up kind of certain types of work and as a freelance photographer I guess that that can be kind of a problem and they\'re also stopping you or you feel like it\'s stunting you socially You\'re not kind of able to make new friends and get to meet new people. Yeah. Yeah And It was kind of easier when I was at home because I was obviously I mean my parents is that\'s fine But you know, they would I\'d go to places with them or I\'d kind of have people there, but more and more I\'m just finding myself just staying in a lot I mean, I went like two weeks go for coffee with my friends and the whole time I was just kind of wanting to go home again. So I don\'t I just don\'t want to I don\'t want that to happen I don\'t want to lose everyone So, so you\'re kind of worried about how where this is gonna lead to yeah Yeah So you said that you first noticed the anxiety kicking in when about five or six years ago So you would have been about 19. Yeah, and what was happening around that time? I guess I\'d finished school about a year before that And I mean I\'ve always been a bit shy at school But it was never ever Like it didn\'t really affect that things as much as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years I guess it just started when it like my friends went to university and I don\'t know I felt like I was expected to kind of move out or do something and then it just kind of Escalated from there. I just stopped going to parties or I\'d just say no to invitations or I Thought my job would help because I mean, I love it I really like doing photography, but I\'m just kind of getting less and less work as it goes on So which is my far keep saying no What kind of work is the most difficult for you and your job? I guess when it I have to kind of be working with other people and I don\'t like that it\'s like when I\'m trying to kind of Would do an event or something where there\'s a lot of people they\'re not just photographers But actually, you know from like taking phrases of people that I don\'t know I just kind of find myself saying, you know, I mean I want to do them, but Just it\'s scary. So I just don\'t do it So I just tell me a bit more about what happens then so let\'s focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with You know, it\'s gonna involve Photography with with a group of people and you\'re gonna have to have social interaction What kind of thoughts go through your head? just I mean I get really hot and sweaty and I don\'t I feel like everyone\'s kind of looking at me and thinking that I\'m just like really stupid and I feel like they\'re all gonna be staring and thinking I just can\'t do my job and I\'m just an idiot and I Mean they\'ll think that I just look like a weirdo and I just try and I mean I just kind of just try and get out of the situation or just focus on something else So that\'s why I like doing shots where it\'s just me and the camera Because I hope then I can just put all my attention on that Instead of having to you know be with other people Okay, so it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your head then at the point where you get that invitation You think People look people stare people will think I\'m a weirdo There\'s quite a lot about what you what you think other people will think. Yeah, and how does that make you feel? Just makes me feel like an idiot. It makes me feel Like I just shouldn\'t even bother trying to do it anymore I should just go home and I just I think I just don\'t want to be in that situation I just feel like everyone else is fine and they\'re normal And I\'m just the freak you can\'t like do normal things and okay Can you give me an example of a recent situation? Maybe we can focus on that Like a work situation. Yeah time when you were maybe doing a job with some people and you felt the social anxiety You know that you\'re describing you felt that kick in Yeah, I was doing a job where it was kind of like a nature shoot and I was having to work with a lot of different people and And I mean when they told me about the job, I thought it would be fine I thought it was just gonna be a few other photographers, but there were actually people and you know I was taking photos of people kind of in the trees and stuff like that And I get they asked me to him that sounds quite interesting was a fashion shoot. Yeah. Yeah, it was a fashion thing I think it was for some kind of I\'m not sure if it was a campaign or something But it was yeah, it was really cool But I find it found it really hard to try and focus on that So I was kind of feeling really anxious and so it wasn\'t what you expected No, it was no. So how long ago was that? That was two weeks ago. Okay, so it\'s quite recent Yeah, so on that particular day, what were the thoughts that you had in your head when you were in that situation? Just felt really Just really kind of hot I couldn\'t really breathe and just felt like I wanted to just get out and I was kind of trying really really hard to just Focus and just you know, like kind of hold the camera and just not think about anything But I just felt like everyone was looking at me and like when they\'d say Action and they try and get me to start and I was just felt like everyone was just thinking I was really stupid And I shouldn\'t have been there and I can tell you\'re getting kind of anxious even just thinking about that day Yeah, okay. So you\'re describing quite a lot there to me. So you\'re saying that you kind of got hot and sweaty You said that you held the camera Yeah, what was do you mean you kind of trying to hide behind it or just focus on it? I was just thinking if I could just hold it really tightly It would just I don\'t know. I\'d kind of just be able to just get through it and just You\'re holding the camera very tight. Yeah And why was that? Why was that helpful? Because I felt like I was getting really like hot and flushed and I just thought at least if I can just I don\'t know But I was just trying to keep my hands still on it because my hands were kind of sweaty and like shaking like loads I can I could just tell everyone was Looking and they could see and I just thought if I just managed to hold on to it It wouldn\'t be as noticeable but okay. So okay, so it sounds like you had a lot of thoughts going through your head He said that you worried that everyone\'s looking at you. What other thoughts were there that were in your mind? just I was just Just stupid and it was just really just felt really like kind of like everyone was just going to be staring and just thinking that I just felt like everyone was looking at me and just They could tell and just thinking or what what\'s she doing and they could tell what I was just really like sweaty and just Okay, so like that they could see that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, and so I was trying to wear black So this kind of tries to cover it up and just like a lot of layers So they can\'t tell but I mean my hands like they was so shaking I was really red and just just just wishing that I just wasn\'t there So, I mean you\'ve already described it to me a little bit But if you think about how you looked that day, how do you say how do you think you looked? I think just really stupid and like I think my face was really red I could feel it flushing and I knew that I was probably sweating and Shaking like my hands were definitely really really shaking and It was like definitely really noticeable. Everyone could definitely stay. Okay. And what what did you do about? How did you try and conceal that or hide that? Well, again, I was trying to grip the camera Just look down just trying not to do anything weird or because I mean they could probably tell I was being weird anyway but hopefully if I just tried really hard to just focus and Look down not try it and like not look at anyone else and just Yeah, just kind of try and get on with it as best as I could but so you avoided looking at people It sounds like you wore black as well. Yeah in kind of preparation in any way Yeah No I always do that even if it\'s really hot or I wear just loads of layers and just because otherwise I\'ll just be really sweaty and like People would definitely be able to see so okay. And how did it end? Well, it kind of went on for like an hour or so and then people were going and Just after every shoot people go out for drinks after just to kind of celebrate like that We\'ve done it, but I just I went home straight away. Just got in my car and went home I just didn\'t want to be around them Especially after they would have seen me being weird and I just wanted to get get home straight away Okay\n\n    请按照以下维度cleaning对话内容：\n    去除无关内容, 处理缺失和不完整数据, 数据规范化, 去除特殊字符和标点, 停用词处理, 分词和词形还原, 处理重复和冗余信息, 匿名化和隐私保护, 纠正语法和拼写错误\n\n    示例输出格式：\n    {\n        "conversations": [\n            {\n                "input": "最近我觉得自己压力很大，生活中的事情都让人喘不过气来，我经常感到很焦虑，不知道该怎么办。",\n                "output": "听起来你正经历着很大的压力，这一定让你感到很不安。能和我分享一下，是什么事情让你感到焦虑呢？"\n            },\n            {\n                "input": "用户的下一句话",\n                "output": "AI的下一句回复"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    '}], 'model': 'deepseek-chat', 'max_tokens': 4000, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.2}}

Hi. So I understand that you were referred to me by your GP because you\'ve been experiencing some anxiety difficulties. Yeah, um Yeah, I guess it kind of started like five, six years ago. Okay, um It kind of escalated a bit and I\'ve just recently moved out and from living with my parents So it\'s made it a bit worse. I think Okay, is this the first time that you\'ve left home? Yeah, I am Yeah, it\'s the first time actually. Yeah, and I was going to a few years ago. I just thought it\'d be easier to stay home So, okay, so it\'s been quite a big step and a big change and and it sounds like that So that was what led you to go to your GP. Yeah, so how has that changed things for you? Do you know it\'s kind of I haven\'t really told anyone so I mean It\'s made it like better in the sense I feel hopefully this is you know, this is it like it will it\'ll help But I don\'t know. I don\'t like thinking that I\'ve like had to do this I never thought I\'d like be the kind of person who\'d have to actually go and like get help if that makes sense Okay, so how do you feel about being here today? It\'s like scared. I don\'t know. Hopefully it will help. Okay, so you\'ve been feeling a little bit anxious about today. Yeah Okay, so I guess just going back to why you went to the GP and how you\'ve ended up kind of coming here today So it sounds like you\'ve been experiencing anxiety for quite a few years But just recently you moved out of home for the first time and and that was what kind of led you to go to the GP So how did that change things? How were things after you moved out? I thought that they\'d be better but because I thought I\'d have to kind of be independent and it\'s actually a lot worse I\'m just kind of staying in the house a lot. I don\'t really have any friends or anything I mean my family come and visit a bit, but it\'s not I don\'t know It\'s kind of scary because I\'ve just been kind of literally just in the flat by myself Which I always thought I\'d like but I don\'t actually like it Okay, so what other kind of difficulties that you have been experiencing and I mean, I\'m I\'m a photographer and So I kind of it\'s been stopping me a bit my anxiety from being able to get work and Because every time you know, there\'s an opportunity that is kind of involving me having to interact with people I just tend to just turn it down. So it\'s kind of making things hard in that respect and Just kind of friends wise and everything. I just feel like I\'m just kind of increasingly more alone So it\'s kind of stopping me from making friends and you know, like relationships and stuff Okay, so you said that Your difficulties are getting in the way of you doing certain things So they\'re they\'re stopping you from taking up kind of certain types of work and as a freelance photographer I guess that that can be kind of a problem and they\'re also stopping you or you feel like it\'s stunting you socially You\'re not kind of able to make new friends and get to meet new people. Yeah. Yeah And It was kind of easier when I was at home because I was obviously I mean my parents is that\'s fine But you know, they would I\'d go to places with them or I\'d kind of have people there, but more and more I\'m just finding myself just staying in a lot I mean, I went like two weeks go for coffee with my friends and the whole time I was just kind of wanting to go home again. So I don\'t I just don\'t want to I don\'t want that to happen I don\'t want to lose everyone So, so you\'re kind of worried about how where this is gonna lead to yeah Yeah So you said that you first noticed the anxiety kicking in when about five or six years ago So you would have been about 19. Yeah, and what was happening around that time? I guess I\'d finished school about a year before that And I mean I\'ve always been a bit shy at school But it was never ever Like it didn\'t really affect that things as much as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years I guess it just started when it like my friends went to university and I don\'t know I felt like I was expected to kind of move out or do something and then it just kind of Escalated from there. I just stopped going to parties or I\'d just say no to invitations or I Thought my job would help because I mean, I love it I really like doing photography, but I\'m just kind of getting less and less work as it goes on So which is my far keep saying no What kind of work is the most difficult for you and your job? I guess when it I have to kind of be working with other people and I don\'t like that it\'s like when I\'m trying to kind of Would do an event or something where there\'s a lot of people they\'re not just photographers But actually, you know from like taking phrases of people that I don\'t know I just kind of find myself saying, you know, I mean I want to do them, but Just it\'s scary. So I just don\'t do it So I just tell me a bit more about what happens then so let\'s focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with You know, it\'s gonna involve Photography with with a group of people and you\'re gonna have to have social interaction What kind of thoughts go through your head? just I mean I get really hot and sweaty and I don\'t I feel like everyone\'s kind of looking at me and thinking that I\'m just like really stupid and I feel like they\'re all gonna be staring and thinking I just can\'t do my job and I\'m just an idiot and I Mean they\'ll think that I just look like a weirdo and I just try and I mean I just kind of just try and get out of the situation or just focus on something else So that\'s why I like doing shots where it\'s just me and the camera Because I hope then I can just put all my attention on that Instead of having to you know be with other people Okay, so it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your head then at the point where you get that invitation You think People look people stare people will think I\'m a weirdo There\'s quite a lot about what you what you think other people will think. Yeah, and how does that make you feel? Just makes me feel like an idiot. It makes me feel Like I just shouldn\'t even bother trying to do it anymore I should just go home and I just I think I just don\'t want to be in that situation I just feel like everyone else is fine and they\'re normal And I\'m just the freak you can\'t like do normal things and okay Can you give me an example of a recent situation? Maybe we can focus on that Like a work situation. Yeah time when you were maybe doing a job with some people and you felt the social anxiety You know that you\'re describing you felt that kick in Yeah, I was doing a job where it was kind of like a nature shoot and I was having to work with a lot of different people and And I mean when they told me about the job, I thought it would be fine I thought it was just gonna be a few other photographers, but there were actually people and you know I was taking photos of people kind of in the trees and stuff like that And I get they asked me to him that sounds quite interesting was a fashion shoot. Yeah. Yeah, it was a fashion thing I think it was for some kind of I\'m not sure if it was a campaign or something But it was yeah, it was really cool But I find it found it really hard to try and focus on that So I was kind of feeling really anxious and so it wasn\'t what you expected No, it was no. So how long ago was that? That was two weeks ago. Okay, so it\'s quite recent Yeah, so on that particular day, what were the thoughts that you had in your head when you were in that situation? Just felt really Just really kind of hot I couldn\'t really breathe and just felt like I wanted to just get out and I was kind of trying really really hard to just Focus and just you know, like kind of hold the camera and just not think about anything But I just felt like everyone was looking at me and like when they\'d say Action and they try and get me to start and I was just felt like everyone was just thinking I was really stupid And I shouldn\'t have been there and I can tell you\'re getting kind of anxious even just thinking about that day Yeah, okay. So you\'re describing quite a lot there to me. So you\'re saying that you kind of got hot and sweaty You said that you held the camera Yeah, what was do you mean you kind of trying to hide behind it or just focus on it? I was just thinking if I could just hold it really tightly It would just I don\'t know. I\'d kind of just be able to just get through it and just You\'re holding the camera very tight. Yeah And why was that? Why was that helpful? Because I felt like I was getting really like hot and flushed and I just thought at least if I can just I don\'t know But I was just trying to keep my hands still on it because my hands were kind of sweaty and like shaking like loads I can I could just tell everyone was Looking and they could see and I just thought if I just managed to hold on to it It wouldn\'t be as noticeable but okay. So okay, so it sounds like you had a lot of thoughts going through your head He said that you worried that everyone\'s looking at you. What other thoughts were there that were in your mind? just I was just Just stupid and it was just really just felt really like kind of like everyone was just going to be staring and just thinking that I just felt like everyone was looking at me and just They could tell and just thinking or what what\'s she doing and they could tell what I was just really like sweaty and just Okay, so like that they could see that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, and so I was trying to wear black So this kind of tries to cover it up and just like a lot of layers So they can\'t tell but I mean my hands like they was so shaking I was really red and just just just wishing that I just wasn\'t there So, I mean you\'ve already described it to me a little bit But if you think about how you looked that day, how do you say how do you think you looked? I think just really stupid and like I think my face was really red I could feel it flushing and I knew that I was probably sweating and Shaking like my hands were definitely really really shaking and It was like definitely really noticeable. Everyone could definitely stay. Okay. And what what did you do about? How did you try and conceal that or hide that? Well, again, I was trying to grip the camera Just look down just trying not to do anything weird or because I mean they could probably tell I was being weird anyway but hopefully if I just tried really hard to just focus and Look down not try it and like not look at anyone else and just Yeah, just kind of try and get on with it as best as I could but so you avoided looking at people It sounds like you wore black as well. Yeah in kind of preparation in any way Yeah No I always do that even if it\'s really hot or I wear just loads of layers and just because otherwise I\'ll just be really sweaty and like People would definitely be able to see so okay. And how did it end? Well, it kind of went on for like an hour or so and then people were going and Just after every shoot people go out for drinks after just to kind of celebrate like that We\'ve done it, but I just I went home straight away. Just got in my car and went home I just didn\'t want to be around them Especially after they would have seen me being weird and I just wanted to get get home straight away Okay\n\n    请按照以下维度cleaning对话内容：\n    去除无关内容, 处理缺失和不完整数据, 数据规范化, 去除特殊字符和标点, 停用词处理, 分词和词形还原, 处理重复和冗余信息, 匿名化和隐私保护, 纠正语法和拼写错误\n\n    示例输出格式：\n    {\n        "conversations": [\n            {\n                "input": "最近我觉得自己压力很大，生活中的事情都让人喘不过气来，我经常感到很焦虑，不知道该怎么办。",\n                "output": "听起来你正经历着很大的压力，这一定让你感到很不安。能和我分享一下，是什么事情让你感到焦虑呢？"\n            },\n            {\n                "input": "用户的下一句话",\n                "output": "AI的下一句回复"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    '}], 'model': 'deepseek-chat', 'max_tokens': 4000, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.2}}

Hi. So I understand that you were referred to me by your GP because you\'ve been experiencing some anxiety difficulties. Yeah, um Yeah, I guess it kind of started like five, six years ago. Okay, um It kind of escalated a bit and I\'ve just recently moved out and from living with my parents So it\'s made it a bit worse. I think Okay, is this the first time that you\'ve left home? Yeah, I am Yeah, it\'s the first time actually. Yeah, and I was going to a few years ago. I just thought it\'d be easier to stay home So, okay, so it\'s been quite a big step and a big change and and it sounds like that So that was what led you to go to your GP. Yeah, so how has that changed things for you? Do you know it\'s kind of I haven\'t really told anyone so I mean It\'s made it like better in the sense I feel hopefully this is you know, this is it like it will it\'ll help But I don\'t know. I don\'t like thinking that I\'ve like had to do this I never thought I\'d like be the kind of person who\'d have to actually go and like get help if that makes sense Okay, so how do you feel about being here today? It\'s like scared. I don\'t know. Hopefully it will help. Okay, so you\'ve been feeling a little bit anxious about today. Yeah Okay, so I guess just going back to why you went to the GP and how you\'ve ended up kind of coming here today So it sounds like you\'ve been experiencing anxiety for quite a few years But just recently you moved out of home for the first time and and that was what kind of led you to go to the GP So how did that change things? How were things after you moved out? I thought that they\'d be better but because I thought I\'d have to kind of be independent and it\'s actually a lot worse I\'m just kind of staying in the house a lot. I don\'t really have any friends or anything I mean my family come and visit a bit, but it\'s not I don\'t know It\'s kind of scary because I\'ve just been kind of literally just in the flat by myself Which I always thought I\'d like but I don\'t actually like it Okay, so what other kind of difficulties that you have been experiencing and I mean, I\'m I\'m a photographer and So I kind of it\'s been stopping me a bit my anxiety from being able to get work and Because every time you know, there\'s an opportunity that is kind of involving me having to interact with people I just tend to just turn it down. So it\'s kind of making things hard in that respect and Just kind of friends wise and everything. I just feel like I\'m just kind of increasingly more alone So it\'s kind of stopping me from making friends and you know, like relationships and stuff Okay, so you said that Your difficulties are getting in the way of you doing certain things So they\'re they\'re stopping you from taking up kind of certain types of work and as a freelance photographer I guess that that can be kind of a problem and they\'re also stopping you or you feel like it\'s stunting you socially You\'re not kind of able to make new friends and get to meet new people. Yeah. Yeah And It was kind of easier when I was at home because I was obviously I mean my parents is that\'s fine But you know, they would I\'d go to places with them or I\'d kind of have people there, but more and more I\'m just finding myself just staying in a lot I mean, I went like two weeks go for coffee with my friends and the whole time I was just kind of wanting to go home again. So I don\'t I just don\'t want to I don\'t want that to happen I don\'t want to lose everyone So, so you\'re kind of worried about how where this is gonna lead to yeah Yeah So you said that you first noticed the anxiety kicking in when about five or six years ago So you would have been about 19. Yeah, and what was happening around that time? I guess I\'d finished school about a year before that And I mean I\'ve always been a bit shy at school But it was never ever Like it didn\'t really affect that things as much as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years I guess it just started when it like my friends went to university and I don\'t know I felt like I was expected to kind of move out or do something and then it just kind of Escalated from there. I just stopped going to parties or I\'d just say no to invitations or I Thought my job would help because I mean, I love it I really like doing photography, but I\'m just kind of getting less and less work as it goes on So which is my far keep saying no What kind of work is the most difficult for you and your job? I guess when it I have to kind of be working with other people and I don\'t like that it\'s like when I\'m trying to kind of Would do an event or something where there\'s a lot of people they\'re not just photographers But actually, you know from like taking phrases of people that I don\'t know I just kind of find myself saying, you know, I mean I want to do them, but Just it\'s scary. So I just don\'t do it So I just tell me a bit more about what happens then so let\'s focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with You know, it\'s gonna involve Photography with with a group of people and you\'re gonna have to have social interaction What kind of thoughts go through your head? just I mean I get really hot and sweaty and I don\'t I feel like everyone\'s kind of looking at me and thinking that I\'m just like really stupid and I feel like they\'re all gonna be staring and thinking I just can\'t do my job and I\'m just an idiot and I Mean they\'ll think that I just look like a weirdo and I just try and I mean I just kind of just try and get out of the situation or just focus on something else So that\'s why I like doing shots where it\'s just me and the camera Because I hope then I can just put all my attention on that Instead of having to you know be with other people Okay, so it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your head then at the point where you get that invitation You think People look people stare people will think I\'m a weirdo There\'s quite a lot about what you what you think other people will think. Yeah, and how does that make you feel? Just makes me feel like an idiot. It makes me feel Like I just shouldn\'t even bother trying to do it anymore I should just go home and I just I think I just don\'t want to be in that situation I just feel like everyone else is fine and they\'re normal And I\'m just the freak you can\'t like do normal things and okay Can you give me an example of a recent situation? Maybe we can focus on that Like a work situation. Yeah time when you were maybe doing a job with some people and you felt the social anxiety You know that you\'re describing you felt that kick in Yeah, I was doing a job where it was kind of like a nature shoot and I was having to work with a lot of different people and And I mean when they told me about the job, I thought it would be fine I thought it was just gonna be a few other photographers, but there were actually people and you know I was taking photos of people kind of in the trees and stuff like that And I get they asked me to him that sounds quite interesting was a fashion shoot. Yeah. Yeah, it was a fashion thing I think it was for some kind of I\'m not sure if it was a campaign or something But it was yeah, it was really cool But I find it found it really hard to try and focus on that So I was kind of feeling really anxious and so it wasn\'t what you expected No, it was no. So how long ago was that? That was two weeks ago. Okay, so it\'s quite recent Yeah, so on that particular day, what were the thoughts that you had in your head when you were in that situation? Just felt really Just really kind of hot I couldn\'t really breathe and just felt like I wanted to just get out and I was kind of trying really really hard to just Focus and just you know, like kind of hold the camera and just not think about anything But I just felt like everyone was looking at me and like when they\'d say Action and they try and get me to start and I was just felt like everyone was just thinking I was really stupid And I shouldn\'t have been there and I can tell you\'re getting kind of anxious even just thinking about that day Yeah, okay. So you\'re describing quite a lot there to me. So you\'re saying that you kind of got hot and sweaty You said that you held the camera Yeah, what was do you mean you kind of trying to hide behind it or just focus on it? I was just thinking if I could just hold it really tightly It would just I don\'t know. I\'d kind of just be able to just get through it and just You\'re holding the camera very tight. Yeah And why was that? Why was that helpful? Because I felt like I was getting really like hot and flushed and I just thought at least if I can just I don\'t know But I was just trying to keep my hands still on it because my hands were kind of sweaty and like shaking like loads I can I could just tell everyone was Looking and they could see and I just thought if I just managed to hold on to it It wouldn\'t be as noticeable but okay. So okay, so it sounds like you had a lot of thoughts going through your head He said that you worried that everyone\'s looking at you. What other thoughts were there that were in your mind? just I was just Just stupid and it was just really just felt really like kind of like everyone was just going to be staring and just thinking that I just felt like everyone was looking at me and just They could tell and just thinking or what what\'s she doing and they could tell what I was just really like sweaty and just Okay, so like that they could see that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, and so I was trying to wear black So this kind of tries to cover it up and just like a lot of layers So they can\'t tell but I mean my hands like they was so shaking I was really red and just just just wishing that I just wasn\'t there So, I mean you\'ve already described it to me a little bit But if you think about how you looked that day, how do you say how do you think you looked? I think just really stupid and like I think my face was really red I could feel it flushing and I knew that I was probably sweating and Shaking like my hands were definitely really really shaking and It was like definitely really noticeable. Everyone could definitely stay. Okay. And what what did you do about? How did you try and conceal that or hide that? Well, again, I was trying to grip the camera Just look down just trying not to do anything weird or because I mean they could probably tell I was being weird anyway but hopefully if I just tried really hard to just focus and Look down not try it and like not look at anyone else and just Yeah, just kind of try and get on with it as best as I could but so you avoided looking at people It sounds like you wore black as well. Yeah in kind of preparation in any way Yeah No I always do that even if it\'s really hot or I wear just loads of layers and just because otherwise I\'ll just be really sweaty and like People would definitely be able to see so okay.

Hi. So I understand that you were referred to me by your GP because you\'ve been experiencing some anxiety difficulties. Yeah, um Yeah, I guess it kind of started like five, six years ago. Okay, um It kind of escalated a bit and I\'ve just recently moved out and from living with my parents So it\'s made it a bit worse. I think Okay, is this the first time that you\'ve left home? Yeah, I am Yeah, it\'s the first time actually. Yeah, and I was going to a few years ago. I just thought it\'d be easier to stay home So, okay, so it\'s been quite a big step and a big change and and it sounds like that So that was what led you to go to your GP. Yeah, so how has that changed things for you? Do you know it\'s kind of I haven\'t really told anyone so I mean It\'s made it like better in the sense I feel hopefully this is you know, this is it like it will it\'ll help But I don\'t know. I don\'t like thinking that I\'ve like had to do this I never thought I\'d like be the kind of person who\'d have to actually go and like get help if that makes sense Okay, so how do you feel about being here today? It\'s like scared. I don\'t know. Hopefully it will help. Okay, so you\'ve been feeling a little bit anxious about today. Yeah Okay, so I guess just going back to why you went to the GP and how you\'ve ended up kind of coming here today So it sounds like you\'ve been experiencing anxiety for quite a few years But just recently you moved out of home for the first time and and that was what kind of led you to go to the GP So how did that change things? How were things after you moved out? I thought that they\'d be better but because I thought I\'d have to kind of be independent and it\'s actually a lot worse I\'m just kind of staying in the house a lot. I don\'t really have any friends or anything I mean my family come and visit a bit, but it\'s not I don\'t know It\'s kind of scary because I\'ve just been kind of literally just in the flat by myself Which I always thought I\'d like but I don\'t actually like it Okay, so what other kind of difficulties that you have been experiencing and I mean, I\'m I\'m a photographer and So I kind of it\'s been stopping me a bit my anxiety from being able to get work and Because every time you know, there\'s an opportunity that is kind of involving me having to interact with people I just tend to just turn it down. So it\'s kind of making things hard in that respect and Just kind of friends wise and everything. I just feel like I\'m just kind of increasingly more alone So it\'s kind of stopping me from making friends and you know, like relationships and stuff Okay, so you said that Your difficulties are getting in the way of you doing certain things So they\'re they\'re stopping you from taking up kind of certain types of work and as a freelance photographer I guess that that can be kind of a problem and they\'re also stopping you or you feel like it\'s stunting you socially You\'re not kind of able to make new friends and get to meet new people. Yeah. Yeah And It was kind of easier when I was at home because I was obviously I mean my parents is that\'s fine But you know, they would I\'d go to places with them or I\'d kind of have people there, but more and more I\'m just finding myself just staying in a lot I mean, I went like two weeks go for coffee with my friends and the whole time I was just kind of wanting to go home again. So I don\'t I just don\'t want to I don\'t want that to happen I don\'t want to lose everyone So, so you\'re kind of worried about how where this is gonna lead to yeah Yeah So you said that you first noticed the anxiety kicking in when about five or six years ago So you would have been about 19. Yeah, and what was happening around that time? I guess I\'d finished school about a year before that And I mean I\'ve always been a bit shy at school But it was never ever Like it didn\'t really affect that things as much as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years I guess it just started when it like my friends went to university and I don\'t know I felt like I was expected to kind of move out or do something and then it just kind of Escalated from there. I just stopped going to parties or I\'d just say no to invitations or I Thought my job would help because I mean, I love it I really like doing photography, but I\'m just kind of getting less and less work as it goes on So which is my far keep saying no What kind of work is the most difficult for you and your job? I guess when it I have to kind of be working with other people and I don\'t like that it\'s like when I\'m trying to kind of Would do an event or something where there\'s a lot of people they\'re not just photographers But actually, you know from like taking phrases of people that I don\'t know I just kind of find myself saying, you know, I mean I want to do them, but Just it\'s scary. So I just don\'t do it So I just tell me a bit more about what happens then so let\'s focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with You know, it\'s gonna involve Photography with with a group of people and you\'re gonna have to have social interaction What kind of thoughts go through your head? just I mean I get really hot and sweaty and I don\'t I feel like everyone\'s kind of looking at me and thinking that I\'m just like really stupid and I feel like they\'re all gonna be staring and thinking I just can\'t do my job and I\'m just an idiot and I Mean they\'ll think that I just look like a weirdo and I just try and I mean I just kind of just try and get out of the situation or just focus on something else So that\'s why I like doing shots where it\'s just me and the camera Because I hope then I can just put all my attention on that Instead of having to you know be with other people Okay, so it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your head then at the point where you get that invitation You think People look people stare people will think I\'m a weirdo There\'s quite a lot about what you what you think other people will think. Yeah, and how does that make you feel? Just makes me feel like an idiot. It makes me feel Like I just shouldn\'t even bother trying to do it anymore I should just go home and I just I think I just don\'t want to be in that situation I just feel like everyone else is fine and they\'re normal And I\'m just the freak you can\'t like do normal things and okay Can you give me an example of a recent situation? Maybe we can focus on that Like a work situation. Yeah time when you were maybe doing a job with some people and you felt the social anxiety You know that you\'re describing you felt that kick in Yeah, I was doing a job where it was kind of like a nature shoot and I was having to work with a lot of different people and And I mean when they told me about the job, I thought it would be fine I thought it was just gonna be a few other photographers, but there were actually people and you know I was taking photos of people kind of in the trees and stuff like that And I get they asked me to him that sounds quite interesting was a fashion shoot. Yeah. Yeah, it was a fashion thing I think it was for some kind of I\'m not sure if it was a campaign or something But it was yeah, it was really cool But I find it found it really hard to try and focus on that So I was kind of feeling really anxious and so it wasn\'t what you expected No, it was no. So how long ago was that? That was two weeks ago. Okay, so it\'s quite recent Yeah, so on that particular day, what were the thoughts that you had in your head when you were in that situation? Just felt really Just really kind of hot I couldn\'t really breathe and just felt like I wanted to just get out and I was kind of trying really really hard to just Focus and just you know, like kind of hold the camera and just not think about anything But I just felt like everyone was looking at me and like when they\'d say Action and they try and get me to start and I was just felt like everyone was just thinking I was really stupid And I shouldn\'t have been there and I can tell you\'re getting kind of anxious even just thinking about that day Yeah, okay. So you\'re describing quite a lot there to me. So you\'re saying that you kind of got hot and sweaty You said that you held the camera Yeah, what was do you mean you kind of trying to hide behind it or just focus on it? I was just thinking if I could just hold it really tightly It would just I don\'t know. I\'d kind of just be able to just get through it and just You\'re holding the camera very tight. Yeah And why was that? Why was that helpful? Because I felt like I was getting really like hot and flushed and I just thought at least if I can just I don\'t know But I was just trying to keep my hands still on it because my hands were kind of sweaty and like shaking like loads I can I could just tell everyone was Looking and they could see and I just thought if I just managed to hold on to it It wouldn\'t be as noticeable but okay. So okay, so it sounds like you had a lot of thoughts going through your head He said that you worried that everyone\'s looking at you. What other thoughts were there that were in your mind? just I was just Just stupid and it was just really just felt really like kind of like everyone was just going to be staring and just thinking that I just felt like everyone was looking at me and just They could tell and just thinking or what what\'s she doing and they could tell what I was just really like sweaty and just Okay, so like that they could see that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, and so I was trying to wear black So this kind of tries to cover it up and just like a lot of layers So they can\'t tell but I mean my hands like they was so shaking I was really red and just just just wishing that I just wasn\'t there So, I mean you\'ve already described it to me a little bit But if you think about how you looked that day, how do you say how do you think you looked? I think just really stupid and like I think my face was really red I could feel it flushing and I knew that I was probably sweating and Shaking like my hands were definitely really really shaking and It was like definitely really noticeable. Everyone could definitely stay. Okay. And what what did you do about? How did you try and conceal that or hide that? Well, again, I was trying to grip the camera Just look down just trying not to do anything weird or because I mean they could probably tell I was being weird anyway but hopefully if I just tried really hard to just focus and Look down not try it and like not look at anyone else and just Yeah, just kind of try and get on with it as best as I could but so you avoided looking at people It sounds like you wore black as well. Yeah in kind of preparation in any way Yeah No I always do that even if it\'s really hot or I wear just loads of layers and just because otherwise I\'ll just be really sweaty and like People would definitely be able to see so okay. And how did it end? Well, it kind of went on for like an hour or so and then people were going and Just after every shoot people go out for drinks after just to kind of celebrate like that We\'ve done it, but I just I went home straight away. Just got in my car and went home I just didn\'t want to be around them Especially after they would have seen me being weird and I just wanted to get get home straight away Okay\n\n    请按照以下维度cleaning对话内容：\n    去除无关内容, 处理缺失和不完整数据, 数据规范化, 去除特殊字符和标点, 停用词处理, 分词和词形还原, 处理重复和冗余信息, 匿名化和隐私保护, 纠正语法和拼写错误\n\n    示例输出格式：\n    {\n        "conversations": [\n            {\n                "input": "最近我觉得自己压力很大，生活中的事情都让人喘不过气来，我经常感到很焦虑，不知道该怎么办。",\n                "output": "听起来你正经历着很大的压力，这一定让你感到很不安。能和我分享一下，是什么事情让你感到焦虑呢？"\n            },\n            {\n                "input": "用户的下一句话",\n                "output": "AI的下一句回复"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    '}], 'model': 'deepseek-chat', 'max_tokens': 4000, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.2}}

Hi. So I understand that you were referred to me by your GP because you\'ve been experiencing some anxiety difficulties. Yeah, um Yeah, I guess it kind of started like five, six years ago. Okay, um It kind of escalated a bit and I\'ve just recently moved out and from living with my parents So it\'s made it a bit worse. I think Okay, is this the first time that you\'ve left home? Yeah, I am Yeah, it\'s the first time actually. Yeah, and I was going to a few years ago. I just thought it\'d be easier to stay home So, okay, so it\'s been quite a big step and a big change and and it sounds like that So that was what led you to go to your GP. Yeah, so how has that changed things for you? Do you know it\'s kind of I haven\'t really told anyone so I mean It\'s made it like better in the sense I feel hopefully this is you know, this is it like it will it\'ll help But I don\'t know. I don\'t like thinking that I\'ve like had to do this I never thought I\'d like be the kind of person who\'d have to actually go and like get help if that makes sense Okay, so how do you feel about being here today? It\'s like scared. I don\'t know. Hopefully it will help. Okay, so you\'ve been feeling a little bit anxious about today. Yeah Okay, so I guess just going back to why you went to the GP and how you\'ve ended up kind of coming here today So it sounds like you\'ve been experiencing anxiety for quite a few years But just recently you moved out of home for the first time and and that was what kind of led you to go to the GP So how did that change things? How were things after you moved out? I thought that they\'d be better but because I thought I\'d have to kind of be independent and it\'s actually a lot worse I\'m just kind of staying in the house a lot. I don\'t really have any friends or anything I mean my family come and visit a bit, but it\'s not I don\'t know It\'s kind of scary because I\'ve just been kind of literally just in the flat by myself Which I always thought I\'d like but I don\'t actually like it Okay, so what other kind of difficulties that you have been experiencing and I mean, I\'m I\'m a photographer and So I kind of it\'s been stopping me a bit my anxiety from being able to get work and Because every time you know, there\'s an opportunity that is kind of involving me having to interact with people I just tend to just turn it down. So it\'s kind of making things hard in that respect and Just kind of friends wise and everything. I just feel like I\'m just kind of increasingly more alone So it\'s kind of stopping me from making friends and you know, like relationships and stuff Okay, so you said that Your difficulties are getting in the way of you doing certain things So they\'re they\'re stopping you from taking up kind of certain types of work and as a freelance photographer I guess that that can be kind of a problem and they\'re also stopping you or you feel like it\'s stunting you socially You\'re not kind of able to make new friends and get to meet new people. Yeah. Yeah And It was kind of easier when I was at home because I was obviously I mean my parents is that\'s fine But you know, they would I\'d go to places with them or I\'d kind of have people there, but more and more I\'m just finding myself just staying in a lot I mean, I went like two weeks go for coffee with my friends and the whole time I was just kind of wanting to go home again. So I don\'t I just don\'t want to I don\'t want that to happen I don\'t want to lose everyone So, so you\'re kind of worried about how where this is gonna lead to yeah Yeah So you said that you first noticed the anxiety kicking in when about five or six years ago So you would have been about 19. Yeah, and what was happening around that time? I guess I\'d finished school about a year before that And I mean I\'ve always been a bit shy at school But it was never ever Like it didn\'t really affect that things as much as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years I guess it just started when it like my friends went to university and I don\'t know I felt like I was expected to kind of move out or do something and then it just kind of Escalated from there. I just stopped going to parties or I\'d just say no to invitations or I Thought my job would help because I mean, I love it I really like doing photography, but I\'m just kind of getting less and less work as it goes on So which is my far keep saying no What kind of work is the most difficult for you and your job? I guess when it I have to kind of be working with other people and I don\'t like that it\'s like when I\'m trying to kind of Would do an event or something where there\'s a lot of people they\'re not just photographers But actually, you know from like taking phrases of people that I don\'t know I just kind of find myself saying, you know, I mean I want to do them, but Just it\'s scary. So I just don\'t do it So I just tell me a bit more about what happens then so let\'s focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with You know, it\'s gonna involve Photography with with a group of people and you\'re gonna have to have social interaction What kind of thoughts go through your head? just I mean I get really hot and sweaty and I don\'t I feel like everyone\'s kind of looking at me and thinking that I\'m just like really stupid and I feel like they\'re all gonna be staring and thinking I just can\'t do my job and I\'m just an idiot and I Mean they\'ll think that I just look like a weirdo and I just try and I mean I just kind of just try and get out of the situation or just focus on something else So that\'s why I like doing shots where it\'s just me and the camera Because I hope then I can just put all my attention on that Instead of having to you know be with other people Okay, so it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your head then at the point where you get that invitation You think People look people stare people will think I\'m a weirdo There\'s quite a lot about what you what you think other people will think. Yeah, and how does that make you feel? Just makes me feel like an idiot. It makes me feel Like I just shouldn\'t even bother trying to do it anymore I should just go home and I just I think I just don\'t want to be in that situation I just feel like everyone else is fine and they\'re normal And I\'m just the freak you can\'t like do normal things and okay Can you give me an example of a recent situation? Maybe we can focus on that Like a work situation. Yeah time when you were maybe doing a job with some people and you felt the social anxiety You know that you\'re describing you felt that kick in Yeah, I was doing a job where it was kind of like a nature shoot and I was having to work with a lot of different people and And I mean when they told me about the job, I thought it would be fine I thought it was just gonna be a few other photographers, but there were actually people and you know I was taking photos of people kind of in the trees and stuff like that And I get they asked me to him that sounds quite interesting was a fashion shoot. Yeah. Yeah, it was a fashion thing I think it was for some kind of I\'m not sure if it was a campaign or something But it was yeah, it was really cool But I find it found it really hard to try and focus on that So I was kind of feeling really anxious and so it wasn\'t what you expected No, it was no. So how long ago was that? That was two weeks ago. Okay, so it\'s quite recent Yeah, so on that particular day, what were the thoughts that you had in your head when you were in that situation? Just felt really Just really kind of hot I couldn\'t really breathe and just felt like I wanted to just get out and I was kind of trying really really hard to just Focus and just you know, like kind of hold the camera and just not think about anything But I just felt like everyone was looking at me and like when they\'d say Action and they try and get me to start and I was just felt like everyone was just thinking I was really stupid And I shouldn\'t have been there and I can tell you\'re getting kind of anxious even just thinking about that day Yeah, okay. So you\'re describing quite a lot there to me. So you\'re saying that you kind of got hot and sweaty You said that you held the camera Yeah, what was do you mean you kind of trying to hide behind it or just focus on it? I was just thinking if I could just hold it really tightly It would just I don\'t know. I\'d kind of just be able to just get through it and just You\'re holding the camera very tight. Yeah And why was that? Why was that helpful? Because I felt like I was getting really like hot and flushed and I just thought at least if I can just I don\'t know But I was just trying to keep my hands still on it because my hands were kind of sweaty and like shaking like loads I can I could just tell everyone was Looking and they could see and I just thought if I just managed to hold on to it It wouldn\'t be as noticeable but okay. So okay, so it sounds like you had a lot of thoughts going through your head He said that you worried that everyone\'s looking at you. What other thoughts were there that were in your mind? just I was just Just stupid and it was just really just felt really like kind of like everyone was just going to be staring and just thinking that I just felt like everyone was looking at me and just They could tell and just thinking or what what\'s she doing and they could tell what I was just really like sweaty and just Okay, so like that they could see that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, and so I was trying to wear black So this kind of tries to cover it up and just like a lot of layers So they can\'t tell but I mean my hands like they was so shaking I was really red and just just just wishing that I just wasn\'t there So, I mean you\'ve already described it to me a little bit But if you think about how you looked that day, how do you say how do you think you looked? I think just really stupid and like I think my face was really red I could feel it flushing and I knew that I was probably sweating and Shaking like my hands were definitely really really shaking and It was like definitely really noticeable. Everyone could definitely stay. Okay. And what what did you do about? How did you try and conceal that or hide that? Well, again, I was trying to grip the camera Just look down just trying not to do anything weird or because I mean they could probably tell I was being weird anyway but hopefully if I just tried really hard to just focus and Look down not try it and like not look at anyone else and just Yeah, just kind of try and get on with it as best as I could but so you avoided looking at people It sounds like you wore black as well. Yeah in kind of preparation in any way Yeah No I always do that even if it\'s really hot or I wear just loads of layers and just because otherwise I\'ll just be really sweaty and like People would definitely be able to see so okay. And how did it end? Well, it kind of went on for like an hour or so and then people were going and Just after every shoot people go out for drinks after just to kind of celebrate like that We\'ve done it, but I just I went home straight away. Just got in my car and went home I just didn\'t want to be around them Especially after they would have seen me being weird and I just wanted to get get home straight away Okay\n\n    请按照以下维度cleaning对话内容：\n    去除无关内容, 处理缺失和不完整数据, 数据规范化, 去除特殊字符和标点, 停用词处理, 分词和词形还原, 处理重复和冗余信息, 匿名化和隐私保护, 纠正语法和拼写错误\n\n    示例输出格式：\n    {\n        "conversations": [\n            {\n                "input": "最近我觉得自己压力很大，生活中的事情都让人喘不过气来，我经常感到很焦虑，不知道该怎么办。",\n                "output": "听起来你正经历着很大的压力，这一定让你感到很不安。能和我分享一下，是什么事情让你感到焦虑呢？"\n            },\n            {\n                "input": "用户的下一句话",\n                "output": "AI的下一句回复"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    '}], 'model': 'deepseek-chat', 'max_tokens': 4000, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.2}}

Yeah. Yeah And It was kind of easier when I was at home because I was obviously I mean my parents is that\'s fine But you know, they would I\'d go to places with them or I\'d kind of have people there, but more and more I\'m just finding myself just staying in a lot I mean, I went like two weeks go for coffee with my friends and the whole time I was just kind of wanting to go home again. So I don\'t I just don\'t want to I don\'t want that to happen I don\'t want to lose everyone So, so you\'re kind of worried about how where this is gonna lead to yeah Yeah So you said that you first noticed the anxiety kicking in when about five or six years ago So you would have been about 19. Yeah, and what was happening around that time? I guess I\'d finished school about a year before that And I mean I\'ve always been a bit shy at school But it was never ever Like it didn\'t really affect that things as much as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years I guess it just started when it like my friends went to university and I don\'t know I felt like I was expected to kind of move out or do something and then it just kind of Escalated from there. I just stopped going to parties or I\'d just say no to invitations or I Thought my job would help because I mean, I love it I really like doing photography, but I\'m just kind of getting less and less work as it goes on So which is my far keep saying no What kind of work is the most difficult for you and your job? I guess when it I have to kind of be working with other people and I don\'t like that it\'s like when I\'m trying to kind of Would do an event or something where there\'s a lot of people they\'re not just photographers But actually, you know from like taking phrases of people that I don\'t know I just kind of find myself saying, you know, I mean I want to do them, but Just it\'s scary. So I just don\'t do it So I just tell me a bit more about what happens then so let\'s focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with You know, it\'s gonna involve Photography with with a group of people and you\'re gonna have to have social interaction What kind of thoughts go through your head? just I mean I get really hot and sweaty and I don\'t I feel like everyone\'s kind of looking at me and thinking that I\'m just like really stupid and I feel like they\'re all gonna be staring and thinking I just can\'t do my job and I\'m just an idiot and I Mean they\'ll think that I just look like a weirdo and I just try and I mean I just kind of just try and get out of the situation or just focus on something else So that\'s why I like doing shots where it\'s just me and the camera Because I hope then I can just put all my attention on that Instead of having to you know be with other people Okay, so it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your head then at the point where you get that invitation You think People look people stare people will think I\'m a weirdo There\'s quite a lot about what you what you think other people will think. Yeah, and how does that make you feel? Just makes me feel like an idiot. It makes me feel Like I just shouldn\'t even bother trying to do it anymore I should just go home and I just I think I just don\'t want to be in that situation I just feel like everyone else is fine and they\'re normal And I\'m just the freak you can\'t like do normal things and okay Can you give me an example of a recent situation? Maybe we can focus on that Like a work situation. Yeah time when you were maybe doing a job with some people and you felt the social anxiety You know that you\'re describing you felt that kick in Yeah, I was doing a job where it was kind of like a nature shoot and I was having to work with a lot of different people and And I mean when they told me about the job, I thought it would be fine I thought it was just gonna be a few other photographers, but there were actually people and you know I was taking photos of people kind of in the trees and stuff like that And I get they asked me to him that sounds quite interesting was a fashion shoot. Yeah. Yeah, it was a fashion thing I think it was for some kind of I\'m not sure if it was a campaign or something But it was yeah, it was really cool But I find it found it really hard to try and focus on that So I was kind of feeling really anxious and so it wasn\'t what you expected No, it was no. So how long ago was that? That was two weeks ago. Okay, so it\'s quite recent Yeah, so on that particular day, what were the thoughts that you had in your head when you were in that situation? Just felt really Just really kind of hot I couldn\'t really breathe and just felt like I wanted to just get out and I was kind of trying really really hard to just Focus and just you know, like kind of hold the camera and just not think about anything But I just felt like everyone was looking at me and like when they\'d say Action and they try and get me to start and I was just felt like everyone was just thinking I was really stupid And I shouldn\'t have been there and I can tell you\'re getting kind of anxious even just thinking about that day Yeah, okay. So you\'re describing quite a lot there to me. So you\'re saying that you kind of got hot and sweaty You said that you held the camera Yeah, what was do you mean you kind of trying to hide behind it or just focus on it? I was just thinking if I could just hold it really tightly It would just I don\'t know. I\'d kind of just be able to just get through it and just You\'re holding the camera very tight. Yeah And why was that? Why was that helpful? Because I felt like I was getting really like hot and flushed and I just thought at least if I can just I don\'t know But I was just trying to keep my hands still on it because my hands were kind of sweaty and like shaking like loads I can I could just tell everyone was Looking and they could see and I just thought if I just managed to hold on to it It wouldn\'t be as noticeable but okay. So okay, so it sounds like you had a lot of thoughts going through your head He said that you worried that everyone\'s looking at you. What other thoughts were there that were in your mind? just I was just Just stupid and it was just really just felt really like kind of like everyone was just going to be staring and just thinking that I just felt like everyone was looking at me and just They could tell and just thinking or what what\'s she doing and they could tell what I was just really like sweaty and just Okay, so like that they could see that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, and so I was trying to wear black So this kind of tries to cover it up and just like a lot of layers So they can\'t tell but I mean my hands like they was so shaking I was really red and just just just wishing that I just wasn\'t there So, I mean you\'ve already described it to me a little bit But if you think about how you looked that day, how do you say how do you think you looked? I think just really stupid and like I think my face was really red I could feel it flushing and I knew that I was probably sweating and Shaking like my hands were definitely really really shaking and It was like definitely really noticeable. Everyone could definitely stay. Okay. And what what did you do about? How did you try and conceal that or hide that? Well, again, I was trying to grip the camera Just look down just trying not to do anything weird or because I mean they could probably tell I was being weird anyway but hopefully if I just tried really hard to just focus and Look down not try it and like not look at anyone else and just Yeah, just kind of try and get on with it as best as I could but so you avoided looking at people It sounds like you wore black as well. Yeah in kind of preparation in any way Yeah No I always do that even if it\'s really hot or I wear just loads of layers and just because otherwise I\'ll just be really sweaty and like People would definitely be able to see so okay. And how did it end? Well, it kind of went on for like an hour or so and then people were going and Just after every shoot people go out for drinks after just to kind of celebrate like that We\'ve done it, but I just I went home straight away. Just got in my car and went home I just didn\'t want to be around them Especially after they would have seen me being weird and I just wanted to get get home straight away Okay\n\n    请按照以下维度cleaning对话内容：\n    去除无关内容, 处理缺失和不完整数据, 数据规范化, 去除特殊字符和标点, 停用词处理, 分词和词形还原, 处理重复和冗余信息, 匿名化和隐私保护, 纠正语法和拼写错误\n\n    示例输出格式：\n    {\n        "conversations": [\n            {\n                "input": "最近我觉得自己压力很大，生活中的事情都让人喘不过气来，我经常感到很焦虑，不知道该怎么办。",\n                "output": "听起来你正经历着很大的压力，这一定让你感到很不安。能和我分享一下，是什么事情让你感到焦虑呢？"\n            },\n            {\n                "input": "用户的下一句话",\n                "output": "AI的下一句回复"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    '}], 'model': 'deepseek-chat', 'max_tokens': 4000, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.2}}

Hi. So I understand that you were referred to me by your GP because you\'ve been experiencing some anxiety difficulties. Yeah, um Yeah, I guess it kind of started like five, six years ago. Okay, um It kind of escalated a bit and I\'ve just recently moved out and from living with my parents So it\'s made it a bit worse. I think Okay, is this the first time that you\'ve left home? Yeah, I am Yeah, it\'s the first time actually. Yeah, and I was going to a few years ago. I just thought it\'d be easier to stay home So, okay, so it\'s been quite a big step and a big change and and it sounds like that So that was what led you to go to your GP. Yeah, so how has that changed things for you? Do you know it\'s kind of I haven\'t really told anyone so I mean It\'s made it like better in the sense I feel hopefully this is you know, this is it like it will it\'ll help But I don\'t know. I don\'t like thinking that I\'ve like had to do this I never thought I\'d like be the kind of person who\'d have to actually go and like get help if that makes sense Okay, so how do you feel about being here today? It\'s like scared. I don\'t know. Hopefully it will help. Okay, so you\'ve been feeling a little bit anxious about today. Yeah Okay, so I guess just going back to why you went to the GP and how you\'ve ended up kind of coming here today So it sounds like you\'ve been experiencing anxiety for quite a few years But just recently you moved out of home for the first time and and that was what kind of led you to go to the GP So how did that change things? How were things after you moved out? I thought that they\'d be better but because I thought I\'d have to kind of be independent and it\'s actually a lot worse I\'m just kind of staying in the house a lot. I don\'t really have any friends or anything I mean my family come and visit a bit, but it\'s not I don\'t know It\'s kind of scary because I\'ve just been kind of literally just in the flat by myself Which I always thought I\'d like but I don\'t actually like it Okay, so what other kind of difficulties that you have been experiencing and I mean, I\'m I\'m a photographer and So I kind of it\'s been stopping me a bit my anxiety from being able to get work and Because every time you know, there\'s an opportunity that is kind of involving me having to interact with people I just tend to just turn it down. So it\'s kind of making things hard in that respect and Just kind of friends wise and everything. I just feel like I\'m just kind of increasingly more alone So it\'s kind of stopping me from making friends and you know, like relationships and stuff Okay, so you said that Your difficulties are getting in the way of you doing certain things So they\'re they\'re stopping you from taking up kind of certain types of work and as a freelance photographer I guess that that can be kind of a problem and they\'re also stopping you or you feel like it\'s stunting you socially You\'re not kind of able to make new friends and get to meet new people. Yeah. Yeah And It was kind of easier when I was at home because I was obviously I mean my parents is that\'s fine But you know, they would I\'d go to places with them or I\'d kind of have people there, but more and more I\'m just finding myself just staying in a lot I mean, I went like two weeks go for coffee with my friends and the whole time I was just kind of wanting to go home again. So I don\'t I just don\'t want to I don\'t want that to happen I don\'t want to lose everyone So, so you\'re kind of worried about how where this is gonna lead to yeah Yeah So you said that you first noticed the anxiety kicking in when about five or six years ago So you would have been about 19. Yeah, and what was happening around that time? I guess I\'d finished school about a year before that And I mean I\'ve always been a bit shy at school But it was never ever Like it didn\'t really affect that things as much as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years I guess it just started when it like my friends went to university and I don\'t know I felt like I was expected to kind of move out or do something and then it just kind of Escalated from there. I just stopped going to parties or I\'d just say no to invitations or I Thought my job would help because I mean, I love it I really like doing photography, but I\'m just kind of getting less and less work as it goes on So which is my far keep saying no What kind of work is the most difficult for you and your job? I guess when it I have to kind of be working with other people and I don\'t like that it\'s like when I\'m trying to kind of Would do an event or something where there\'s a lot of people they\'re not just photographers But actually, you know from like taking phrases of people that I don\'t know I just kind of find myself saying, you know, I mean I want to do them, but Just it\'s scary. So I just don\'t do it So I just tell me a bit more about what happens then so let\'s focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with You know, it\'s gonna involve Photography with with a group of people and you\'re gonna have to have social interaction What kind of thoughts go through your head? just I mean I get really hot and sweaty and I don\'t I feel like everyone\'s kind of looking at me and thinking that I\'m just like really stupid and I feel like they\'re all gonna be staring and thinking I just can\'t do my job and I\'m just an idiot and I Mean they\'ll think that I just look like a weirdo and I just try and I mean I just kind of just try and get out of the situation or just focus on something else So that\'s why I like doing shots where it\'s just me and the camera Because I hope then I can just put all my attention on that Instead of having to you know be with other people Okay, so it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your head then at the point where you get that invitation You think People look people stare people will think I\'m a weirdo There\'s quite a lot about what you what you think other people will think. Yeah, and how does that make you feel? Just makes me feel like an idiot. It makes me feel Like I just shouldn\'t even bother trying to do it anymore I should just go home and I just I think I just don\'t want to be in that situation I just feel like everyone else is fine and they\'re normal And I\'m just the freak you can\'t like do normal things and okay Can you give me an example of a recent situation? Maybe we can focus on that Like a work situation. Yeah time when you were maybe doing a job with some people and you felt the social anxiety You know that you\'re describing you felt that kick in Yeah, I was doing a job where it was kind of like a nature shoot and I was having to work with a lot of different people and And I mean when they told me about the job, I thought it would be fine I thought it was just gonna be a few other photographers, but there were actually people and you know I was taking photos of people kind of in the trees and stuff like that And I get they asked me to him that sounds quite interesting was a fashion shoot. Yeah. Yeah, it was a fashion thing I think it was for some kind of I\'m not sure if it was a campaign or something But it was yeah, it was really cool But I find it found it really hard to try and focus on that So I was kind of feeling really anxious and so it wasn\'t what you expected No, it was no. So how long ago was that? That was two weeks ago. Okay, so it\'s quite recent Yeah, so on that particular day, what were the thoughts that you had in your head when you were in that situation? Just felt really Just really kind of hot I couldn\'t really breathe and just felt like I wanted to just get out and I was kind of trying really really hard to just Focus and just you know, like kind of hold the camera and just not think about anything But I just felt like everyone was looking at me and like when they\'d say Action and they try and get me to start and I was just felt like everyone was just thinking I was really stupid And I shouldn\'t have been there and I can tell you\'re getting kind of anxious even just thinking about that day Yeah, okay. So you\'re describing quite a lot there to me. So you\'re saying that you kind of got hot and sweaty You said that you held the camera Yeah, what was do you mean you kind of trying to hide behind it or just focus on it? I was just thinking if I could just hold it really tightly It would just I don\'t know. I\'d kind of just be able to just get through it and just You\'re holding the camera very tight. Yeah And why was that? Why was that helpful? Because I felt like I was getting really like hot and flushed and I just thought at least if I can just I don\'t know But I was just trying to keep my hands still on it because my hands were kind of sweaty and like shaking like loads I can I could just tell everyone was Looking and they could see and I just thought if I just managed to hold on to it It wouldn\'t be as noticeable but okay. So okay, so it sounds like you had a lot of thoughts going through your head He said that you worried that everyone\'s looking at you. What other thoughts were there that were in your mind? just I was just Just stupid and it was just really just felt really like kind of like everyone was just going to be staring and just thinking that I just felt like everyone was looking at me and just They could tell and just thinking or what what\'s she doing and they could tell what I was just really like sweaty and just Okay, so like that they could see that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, and so I was trying to wear black So this kind of tries to cover it up and just like a lot of layers So they can\'t tell but I mean my hands like they was so shaking I was really red and just just just wishing that I just wasn\'t there So, I mean you\'ve already described it to me a little bit But if you think about how you looked that day, how do you say how do you think you looked? I think just really stupid and like I think my face was really red I could feel it flushing and I knew that I was probably sweating and Shaking like my hands were definitely really really shaking and It was like definitely really noticeable. Everyone could definitely stay. Okay. And what what did you do about? How did you try and conceal that or hide that? Well, again, I was trying to grip the camera Just look down just trying not to do anything weird or because I mean they could probably tell I was being weird anyway but hopefully if I just tried really hard to just focus and Look down not try it and like not look at anyone else and just Yeah, just kind of try and get on with it as best as I could but so you avoided looking at people It sounds like you wore black as well. Yeah in kind of preparation in any way Yeah No I always do that even if it\'s really hot or I wear just loads of layers and just because otherwise I\'ll just be really sweaty and like People would definitely be able to see so okay. And how did it end? Well, it kind of went on for like an hour or so and then people were going and Just after every shoot people go out for drinks after just to kind of celebrate like that We\'ve done it, but I just I went home straight away. Just got in my car and went home I just didn\'t want to be around them Especially after they would have seen me being weird and I just wanted to get get home straight away Okay\n\n    请按照以下维度cleaning对话内容：\n    去除无关内容, 处理缺失和不完整数据, 数据规范化, 去除特殊字符和标点, 停用词处理, 分词和词形还原, 处理重复和冗余信息, 匿名化和隐私保护, 纠正语法和拼写错误\n\n    示例输出格式：\n    {\n        "conversations": [\n            {\n                "input": "最近我觉得自己压力很大，生活中的事情都让人喘不过气来，我经常感到很焦虑，不知道该怎么办。",\n                "output": "听起来你正经历着很大的压力，这一定让你感到很不安。能和我分享一下，是什么事情让你感到焦虑呢？"\n            },\n            {\n                "input": "用户的下一句话",\n                "output": "AI的下一句回复"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    '}], 'model': 'deepseek-chat', 'max_tokens': 4000, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.2}}

Hi. So I understand that you were referred to me by your GP because you\'ve been experiencing some anxiety difficulties. Yeah, um Yeah, I guess it kind of started like five, six years ago. Okay, um It kind of escalated a bit and I\'ve just recently moved out and from living with my parents So it\'s made it a bit worse. I think Okay, is this the first time that you\'ve left home? Yeah, I am Yeah, it\'s the first time actually. Yeah, and I was going to a few years ago. I just thought it\'d be easier to stay home So, okay, so it\'s been quite a big step and a big change and and it sounds like that So that was what led you to go to your GP. Yeah, so how has that changed things for you? Do you know it\'s kind of I haven\'t really told anyone so I mean It\'s made it like better in the sense I feel hopefully this is you know, this is it like it will it\'ll help But I don\'t know. I don\'t like thinking that I\'ve like had to do this I never thought I\'d like be the kind of person who\'d have to actually go and like get help if that makes sense Okay, so how do you feel about being here today? It\'s like scared. I don\'t know. Hopefully it will help. Okay, so you\'ve been feeling a little bit anxious about today. Yeah Okay, so I guess just going back to why you went to the GP and how you\'ve ended up kind of coming here today So it sounds like you\'ve been experiencing anxiety for quite a few years But just recently you moved out of home for the first time and and that was what kind of led you to go to the GP So how did that change things? How were things after you moved out? I thought that they\'d be better but because I thought I\'d have to kind of be independent and it\'s actually a lot worse I\'m just kind of staying in the house a lot. I don\'t really have any friends or anything I mean my family come and visit a bit, but it\'s not I don\'t know It\'s kind of scary because I\'ve just been kind of literally just in the flat by myself Which I always thought I\'d like but I don\'t actually like it Okay, so what other kind of difficulties that you have been experiencing and I mean, I\'m I\'m a photographer and So I kind of it\'s been stopping me a bit my anxiety from being able to get work and Because every time you know, there\'s an opportunity that is kind of involving me having to interact with people I just tend to just turn it down. So it\'s kind of making things hard in that respect and Just kind of friends wise and everything. I just feel like I\'m just kind of increasingly more alone So it\'s kind of stopping me from making friends and you know, like relationships and stuff Okay, so you said that Your difficulties are getting in the way of you doing certain things So they\'re they\'re stopping you from taking up kind of certain types of work and as a freelance photographer I guess that that can be kind of a problem and they\'re also stopping you or you feel like it\'s stunting you socially You\'re not kind of able to make new friends and get to meet new people. Yeah. Yeah And It was kind of easier when I was at home because I was obviously I mean my parents is that\'s fine But you know, they would I\'d go to places with them or I\'d kind of have people there, but more and more I\'m just finding myself just staying in a lot I mean, I went like two weeks go for coffee with my friends and the whole time I was just kind of wanting to go home again. So I don\'t I just don\'t want to I don\'t want that to happen I don\'t want to lose everyone So, so you\'re kind of worried about how where this is gonna lead to yeah Yeah So you said that you first noticed the anxiety kicking in when about five or six years ago So you would have been about 19. Yeah, and what was happening around that time? I guess I\'d finished school about a year before that And I mean I\'ve always been a bit shy at school But it was never ever Like it didn\'t really affect that things as much as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years I guess it just started when it like my friends went to university and I don\'t know I felt like I was expected to kind of move out or do something and then it just kind of Escalated from there. I just stopped going to parties or I\'d just say no to invitations or I Thought my job would help because I mean, I love it I really like doing photography, but I\'m just kind of getting less and less work as it goes on So which is my far keep saying no What kind of work is the most difficult for you and your job? I guess when it I have to kind of be working with other people and I don\'t like that it\'s like when I\'m trying to kind of Would do an event or something where there\'s a lot of people they\'re not just photographers But actually, you know from like taking phrases of people that I don\'t know I just kind of find myself saying, you know, I mean I want to do them, but Just it\'s scary. So I just don\'t do it So I just tell me a bit more about what happens then so let\'s focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with You know, it\'s gonna involve Photography with with a group of people and you\'re gonna have to have social interaction What kind of thoughts go through your head? just I mean I get really hot and sweaty and I don\'t I feel like everyone\'s kind of looking at me and thinking that I\'m just like really stupid and I feel like they\'re all gonna be staring and thinking I just can\'t do my job and I\'m just an idiot and I Mean they\'ll think that I just look like a weirdo and I just try and I mean I just kind of just try and get out of the situation or just focus on something else So that\'s why I like doing shots where it\'s just me and the camera Because I hope then I can just put all my attention on that Instead of having to you know be with other people Okay, so it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your head then at the point where you get that invitation You think People look people stare people will think I\'m a weirdo There\'s quite a lot about what you what you think other people will think. Yeah, and how does that make you feel? Just makes me feel like an idiot. It makes me feel Like I just shouldn\'t even bother trying to do it anymore I should just go home and I just I think I just don\'t want to be in that situation I just feel like everyone else is fine and they\'re normal And I\'m just the freak you can\'t like do normal things and okay Can you give me an example of a recent situation? Maybe we can focus on that Like a work situation. Yeah time when you were maybe doing a job with some people and you felt the social anxiety You know that you\'re describing you felt that kick in Yeah, I was doing a job where it was kind of like a nature shoot and I was having to work with a lot of different people and And I mean when they told me about the job, I thought it would be fine I thought it was just gonna be a few other photographers, but there were actually people and you know I was taking photos of people kind of in the trees and stuff like that And I get they asked me to him that sounds quite interesting was a fashion shoot.

Hi. So I understand that you were referred to me by your GP because you\'ve been experiencing some anxiety difficulties. Yeah, um Yeah, I guess it kind of started like five, six years ago. Okay, um It kind of escalated a bit and I\'ve just recently moved out and from living with my parents So it\'s made it a bit worse. I think Okay, is this the first time that you\'ve left home? Yeah, I am Yeah, it\'s the first time actually. Yeah, and I was going to a few years ago. I just thought it\'d be easier to stay home So, okay, so it\'s been quite a big step and a big change and and it sounds like that So that was what led you to go to your GP. Yeah, so how has that changed things for you? Do you know it\'s kind of I haven\'t really told anyone so I mean It\'s made it like better in the sense I feel hopefully this is you know, this is it like it will it\'ll help But I don\'t know. I don\'t like thinking that I\'ve like had to do this I never thought I\'d like be the kind of person who\'d have to actually go and like get help if that makes sense Okay, so how do you feel about being here today? It\'s like scared. I don\'t know. Hopefully it will help. Okay, so you\'ve been feeling a little bit anxious about today. Yeah Okay, so I guess just going back to why you went to the GP and how you\'ve ended up kind of coming here today So it sounds like you\'ve been experiencing anxiety for quite a few years But just recently you moved out of home for the first time and and that was what kind of led you to go to the GP So how did that change things? How were things after you moved out? I thought that they\'d be better but because I thought I\'d have to kind of be independent and it\'s actually a lot worse I\'m just kind of staying in the house a lot. I don\'t really have any friends or anything I mean my family come and visit a bit, but it\'s not I don\'t know It\'s kind of scary because I\'ve just been kind of literally just in the flat by myself Which I always thought I\'d like but I don\'t actually like it Okay, so what other kind of difficulties that you have been experiencing and I mean, I\'m I\'m a photographer and So I kind of it\'s been stopping me a bit my anxiety from being able to get work and Because every time you know, there\'s an opportunity that is kind of involving me having to interact with people I just tend to just turn it down. So it\'s kind of making things hard in that respect and Just kind of friends wise and everything. I just feel like I\'m just kind of increasingly more alone So it\'s kind of stopping me from making friends and you know, like relationships and stuff Okay, so you said that Your difficulties are getting in the way of you doing certain things So they\'re they\'re stopping you from taking up kind of certain types of work and as a freelance photographer I guess that that can be kind of a problem and they\'re also stopping you or you feel like it\'s stunting you socially You\'re not kind of able to make new friends and get to meet new people. Yeah. Yeah And It was kind of easier when I was at home because I was obviously I mean my parents is that\'s fine But you know, they would I\'d go to places with them or I\'d kind of have people there, but more and more I\'m just finding myself just staying in a lot I mean, I went like two weeks go for coffee with my friends and the whole time I was just kind of wanting to go home again. So I don\'t I just don\'t want to I don\'t want that to happen I don\'t want to lose everyone So, so you\'re kind of worried about how where this is gonna lead to yeah Yeah So you said that you first noticed the anxiety kicking in when about five or six years ago So you would have been about 19. Yeah, and what was happening around that time? I guess I\'d finished school about a year before that And I mean I\'ve always been a bit shy at school But it was never ever Like it didn\'t really affect that things as much as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years I guess it just started when it like my friends went to university and I don\'t know I felt like I was expected to kind of move out or do something and then it just kind of Escalated from there. I just stopped going to parties or I\'d just say no to invitations or I Thought my job would help because I mean, I love it I really like doing photography, but I\'m just kind of getting less and less work as it goes on So which is my far keep saying no What kind of work is the most difficult for you and your job? I guess when it I have to kind of be working with other people and I don\'t like that it\'s like when I\'m trying to kind of Would do an event or something where there\'s a lot of people they\'re not just photographers But actually, you know from like taking phrases of people that I don\'t know I just kind of find myself saying, you know, I mean I want to do them, but Just it\'s scary. So I just don\'t do it So I just tell me a bit more about what happens then so let\'s focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with You know, it\'s gonna involve Photography with with a group of people and you\'re gonna have to have social interaction What kind of thoughts go through your head? just I mean I get really hot and sweaty and I don\'t I feel like everyone\'s kind of looking at me and thinking that I\'m just like really stupid and I feel like they\'re all gonna be staring and thinking I just can\'t do my job and I\'m just an idiot and I Mean they\'ll think that I just look like a weirdo and I just try and I mean I just kind of just try and get out of the situation or just focus on something else So that\'s why I like doing shots where it\'s just me and the camera Because I hope then I can just put all my attention on that Instead of having to you know be with other people Okay, so it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your head then at the point where you get that invitation You think People look people stare people will think I\'m a weirdo There\'s quite a lot about what you what you think other people will think. Yeah, and how does that make you feel? Just makes me feel like an idiot. It makes me feel Like I just shouldn\'t even bother trying to do it anymore I should just go home and I just I think I just don\'t want to be in that situation I just feel like everyone else is fine and they\'re normal And I\'m just the freak you can\'t like do normal things and okay Can you give me an example of a recent situation? Maybe we can focus on that Like a work situation. Yeah time when you were maybe doing a job with some people and you felt the social anxiety You know that you\'re describing you felt that kick in Yeah, I was doing a job where it was kind of like a nature shoot and I was having to work with a lot of different people and And I mean when they told me about the job, I thought it would be fine I thought it was just gonna be a few other photographers, but there were actually people and you know I was taking photos of people kind of in the trees and stuff like that And I get they asked me to him that sounds quite interesting was a fashion shoot. Yeah. Yeah, it was a fashion thing I think it was for some kind of I\'m not sure if it was a campaign or something But it was yeah, it was really cool But I find it found it really hard to try and focus on that So I was kind of feeling really anxious and so it wasn\'t what you expected No, it was no. So how long ago was that? That was two weeks ago. Okay, so it\'s quite recent Yeah, so on that particular day, what were the thoughts that you had in your head when you were in that situation? Just felt really Just really kind of hot I couldn\'t really breathe and just felt like I wanted to just get out and I was kind of trying really really hard to just Focus and just you know, like kind of hold the camera and just not think about anything But I just felt like everyone was looking at me and like when they\'d say Action and they try and get me to start and I was just felt like everyone was just thinking I was really stupid And I shouldn\'t have been there and I can tell you\'re getting kind of anxious even just thinking about that day Yeah, okay. So you\'re describing quite a lot there to me. So you\'re saying that you kind of got hot and sweaty You said that you held the camera Yeah, what was do you mean you kind of trying to hide behind it or just focus on it? I was just thinking if I could just hold it really tightly It would just I don\'t know. I\'d kind of just be able to just get through it and just You\'re holding the camera very tight. Yeah And why was that? Why was that helpful? Because I felt like I was getting really like hot and flushed and I just thought at least if I can just I don\'t know But I was just trying to keep my hands still on it because my hands were kind of sweaty and like shaking like loads I can I could just tell everyone was Looking and they could see and I just thought if I just managed to hold on to it It wouldn\'t be as noticeable but okay. So okay, so it sounds like you had a lot of thoughts going through your head He said that you worried that everyone\'s looking at you. What other thoughts were there that were in your mind? just I was just Just stupid and it was just really just felt really like kind of like everyone was just going to be staring and just thinking that I just felt like everyone was looking at me and just They could tell and just thinking or what what\'s she doing and they could tell what I was just really like sweaty and just Okay, so like that they could see that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, and so I was trying to wear black So this kind of tries to cover it up and just like a lot of layers So they can\'t tell but I mean my hands like they was so shaking I was really red and just just just wishing that I just wasn\'t there So, I mean you\'ve already described it to me a little bit But if you think about how you looked that day, how do you say how do you think you looked? I think just really stupid and like I think my face was really red I could feel it flushing and I knew that I was probably sweating and Shaking like my hands were definitely really really shaking and It was like definitely really noticeable. Everyone could definitely stay. Okay. And what what did you do about? How did you try and conceal that or hide that? Well, again, I was trying to grip the camera Just look down just trying not to do anything weird or because I mean they could probably tell I was being weird anyway but hopefully if I just tried really hard to just focus and Look down not try it and like not look at anyone else and just Yeah, just kind of try and get on with it as best as I could but so you avoided looking at people It sounds like you wore black as well. Yeah in kind of preparation in any way Yeah No I always do that even if it\'s really hot or I wear just loads of layers and just because otherwise I\'ll just be really sweaty and like People would definitely be able to see so okay. And how did it end? Well, it kind of went on for like an hour or so and then people were going and Just after every shoot people go out for drinks after just to kind of celebrate like that We\'ve done it, but I just I went home straight away. Just got in my car and went home I just didn\'t want to be around them Especially after they would have seen me being weird and I just wanted to get get home straight away Okay\n\n    请按照以下维度cleaning对话内容：\n    去除无关内容, 处理缺失和不完整数据, 数据规范化, 去除特殊字符和标点, 停用词处理, 分词和词形还原, 处理重复和冗余信息, 匿名化和隐私保护, 纠正语法和拼写错误\n\n    示例输出格式：\n    {\n        "conversations": [\n            {\n                "input": "最近我觉得自己压力很大，生活中的事情都让人喘不过气来，我经常感到很焦虑，不知道该怎么办。",\n                "output": "听起来你正经历着很大的压力，这一定让你感到很不安。能和我分享一下，是什么事情让你感到焦虑呢？"\n            },\n            {\n                "input": "用户的下一句话",\n                "output": "AI的下一句回复"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    '}], 'model': 'deepseek-chat', 'max_tokens': 4000, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.2}}

Hi. So I understand that you were referred to me by your GP because you\'ve been experiencing some anxiety difficulties. Yeah, um Yeah, I guess it kind of started like five, six years ago. Okay, um It kind of escalated a bit and I\'ve just recently moved out and from living with my parents So it\'s made it a bit worse. I think Okay, is this the first time that you\'ve left home? Yeah, I am Yeah, it\'s the first time actually. Yeah, and I was going to a few years ago. I just thought it\'d be easier to stay home So, okay, so it\'s been quite a big step and a big change and and it sounds like that So that was what led you to go to your GP. Yeah, so how has that changed things for you? Do you know it\'s kind of I haven\'t really told anyone so I mean It\'s made it like better in the sense I feel hopefully this is you know, this is it like it will it\'ll help But I don\'t know. I don\'t like thinking that I\'ve like had to do this I never thought I\'d like be the kind of person who\'d have to actually go and like get help if that makes sense Okay, so how do you feel about being here today? It\'s like scared. I don\'t know. Hopefully it will help. Okay, so you\'ve been feeling a little bit anxious about today. Yeah Okay, so I guess just going back to why you went to the GP and how you\'ve ended up kind of coming here today So it sounds like you\'ve been experiencing anxiety for quite a few years But just recently you moved out of home for the first time and and that was what kind of led you to go to the GP So how did that change things? How were things after you moved out? I thought that they\'d be better but because I thought I\'d have to kind of be independent and it\'s actually a lot worse I\'m just kind of staying in the house a lot. I don\'t really have any friends or anything I mean my family come and visit a bit, but it\'s not I don\'t know It\'s kind of scary because I\'ve just been kind of literally just in the flat by myself Which I always thought I\'d like but I don\'t actually like it Okay, so what other kind of difficulties that you have been experiencing and I mean, I\'m I\'m a photographer and So I kind of it\'s been stopping me a bit my anxiety from being able to get work and Because every time you know, there\'s an opportunity that is kind of involving me having to interact with people I just tend to just turn it down. So it\'s kind of making things hard in that respect and Just kind of friends wise and everything. I just feel like I\'m just kind of increasingly more alone So it\'s kind of stopping me from making friends and you know, like relationships and stuff Okay, so you said that Your difficulties are getting in the way of you doing certain things So they\'re they\'re stopping you from taking up kind of certain types of work and as a freelance photographer I guess that that can be kind of a problem and they\'re also stopping you or you feel like it\'s stunting you socially You\'re not kind of able to make new friends and get to meet new people. Yeah. Yeah And It was kind of easier when I was at home because I was obviously I mean my parents is that\'s fine But you know, they would I\'d go to places with them or I\'d kind of have people there, but more and more I\'m just finding myself just staying in a lot I mean, I went like two weeks go for coffee with my friends and the whole time I was just kind of wanting to go home again. So I don\'t I just don\'t want to I don\'t want that to happen I don\'t want to lose everyone So, so you\'re kind of worried about how where this is gonna lead to yeah Yeah So you said that you first noticed the anxiety kicking in when about five or six years ago So you would have been about 19. Yeah, and what was happening around that time? I guess I\'d finished school about a year before that And I mean I\'ve always been a bit shy at school But it was never ever Like it didn\'t really affect that things as much as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years I guess it just started when it like my friends went to university and I don\'t know I felt like I was expected to kind of move out or do something and then it just kind of Escalated from there. I just stopped going to parties or I\'d just say no to invitations or I Thought my job would help because I mean, I love it I really like doing photography, but I\'m just kind of getting less and less work as it goes on So which is my far keep saying no What kind of work is the most difficult for you and your job? I guess when it I have to kind of be working with other people and I don\'t like that it\'s like when I\'m trying to kind of Would do an event or something where there\'s a lot of people they\'re not just photographers But actually, you know from like taking phrases of people that I don\'t know I just kind of find myself saying, you know, I mean I want to do them, but Just it\'s scary. So I just don\'t do it So I just tell me a bit more about what happens then so let\'s focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with You know, it\'s gonna involve Photography with with a group of people and you\'re gonna have to have social interaction What kind of thoughts go through your head? just I mean I get really hot and sweaty and I don\'t I feel like everyone\'s kind of looking at me and thinking that I\'m just like really stupid and I feel like they\'re all gonna be staring and thinking I just can\'t do my job and I\'m just an idiot and I Mean they\'ll think that I just look like a weirdo and I just try and I mean I just kind of just try and get out of the situation or just focus on something else So that\'s why I like doing shots where it\'s just me and the camera Because I hope then I can just put all my attention on that Instead of having to you know be with other people Okay, so it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your head then at the point where you get that invitation You think People look people stare people will think I\'m a weirdo There\'s quite a lot about what you what you think other people will think. Yeah, and how does that make you feel? Just makes me feel like an idiot. It makes me feel Like I just shouldn\'t even bother trying to do it anymore I should just go home and I just I think I just don\'t want to be in that situation I just feel like everyone else is fine and they\'re normal And I\'m just the freak you can\'t like do normal things and okay Can you give me an example of a recent situation? Maybe we can focus on that Like a work situation. Yeah time when you were maybe doing a job with some people and you felt the social anxiety You know that you\'re describing you felt that kick in Yeah, I was doing a job where it was kind of like a nature shoot and I was having to work with a lot of different people and And I mean when they told me about the job, I thought it would be fine I thought it was just gonna be a few other photographers, but there were actually people and you know I was taking photos of people kind of in the trees and stuff like that And I get they asked me to him that sounds quite interesting was a fashion shoot. Yeah. Yeah, it was a fashion thing I think it was for some kind of I\'m not sure if it was a campaign or something But it was yeah, it was really cool But I find it found it really hard to try and focus on that So I was kind of feeling really anxious and so it wasn\'t what you expected No, it was no. So how long ago was that? That was two weeks ago. Okay, so it\'s quite recent Yeah, so on that particular day, what were the thoughts that you had in your head when you were in that situation? Just felt really Just really kind of hot I couldn\'t really breathe and just felt like I wanted to just get out and I was kind of trying really really hard to just Focus and just you know, like kind of hold the camera and just not think about anything But I just felt like everyone was looking at me and like when they\'d say Action and they try and get me to start and I was just felt like everyone was just thinking I was really stupid And I shouldn\'t have been there and I can tell you\'re getting kind of anxious even just thinking about that day Yeah, okay. So you\'re describing quite a lot there to me. So you\'re saying that you kind of got hot and sweaty You said that you held the camera Yeah, what was do you mean you kind of trying to hide behind it or just focus on it? I was just thinking if I could just hold it really tightly It would just I don\'t know. I\'d kind of just be able to just get through it and just You\'re holding the camera very tight. Yeah And why was that? Why was that helpful? Because I felt like I was getting really like hot and flushed and I just thought at least if I can just I don\'t know But I was just trying to keep my hands still on it because my hands were kind of sweaty and like shaking like loads I can I could just tell everyone was Looking and they could see and I just thought if I just managed to hold on to it It wouldn\'t be as noticeable but okay. So okay, so it sounds like you had a lot of thoughts going through your head He said that you worried that everyone\'s looking at you. What other thoughts were there that were in your mind? just I was just Just stupid and it was just really just felt really like kind of like everyone was just going to be staring and just thinking that I just felt like everyone was looking at me and just They could tell and just thinking or what what\'s she doing and they could tell what I was just really like sweaty and just Okay, so like that they could see that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, and so I was trying to wear black So this kind of tries to cover it up and just like a lot of layers So they can\'t tell but I mean my hands like they was so shaking I was really red and just just just wishing that I just wasn\'t there So, I mean you\'ve already described it to me a little bit But if you think about how you looked that day, how do you say how do you think you looked? I think just really stupid and like I think my face was really red I could feel it flushing and I knew that I was probably sweating and Shaking like my hands were definitely really really shaking and It was like definitely really noticeable. Everyone could definitely stay. Okay. And what what did you do about? How did you try and conceal that or hide that? Well, again, I was trying to grip the camera Just look down just trying not to do anything weird or because I mean they could probably tell I was being weird anyway but hopefully if I just tried really hard to just focus and Look down not try it and like not look at anyone else and just Yeah, just kind of try and get on with it as best as I could but so you avoided looking at people It sounds like you wore black as well. Yeah in kind of preparation in any way Yeah No I always do that even if it\'s really hot or I wear just loads of layers and just because otherwise I\'ll just be really sweaty and like People would definitely be able to see so okay. And how did it end? Well, it kind of went on for like an hour or so and then people were going and Just after every shoot people go out for drinks after just to kind of celebrate like that We\'ve done it, but I just I went home straight away. Just got in my car and went home I just didn\'t want to be around them Especially after they would have seen me being weird and I just wanted to get get home straight away Okay\n\n    请按照以下维度cleaning对话内容：\n    去除无关内容, 处理缺失和不完整数据, 数据规范化, 去除特殊字符和标点, 停用词处理, 分词和词形还原, 处理重复和冗余信息, 匿名化和隐私保护, 纠正语法和拼写错误\n\n    示例输出格式：\n    {\n        "conversations": [\n            {\n                "input": "最近我觉得自己压力很大，生活中的事情都让人喘不过气来，我经常感到很焦虑，不知道该怎么办。",\n                "output": "听起来你正经历着很大的压力，这一定让你感到很不安。能和我分享一下，是什么事情让你感到焦虑呢？"\n            },\n            {\n                "input": "用户的下一句话",\n                "output": "AI的下一句回复"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    '}], 'model': 'deepseek-chat', 'max_tokens': 4000, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.2}}

Hi. So I understand that you were referred to me by your GP because you\'ve been experiencing some anxiety difficulties. Yeah, um Yeah, I guess it kind of started like five, six years ago. Okay, um It kind of escalated a bit and I\'ve just recently moved out and from living with my parents So it\'s made it a bit worse. I think Okay, is this the first time that you\'ve left home? Yeah, I am Yeah, it\'s the first time actually. Yeah, and I was going to a few years ago. I just thought it\'d be easier to stay home So, okay, so it\'s been quite a big step and a big change and and it sounds like that So that was what led you to go to your GP. Yeah, so how has that changed things for you? Do you know it\'s kind of I haven\'t really told anyone so I mean It\'s made it like better in the sense I feel hopefully this is you know, this is it like it will it\'ll help But I don\'t know. I don\'t like thinking that I\'ve like had to do this I never thought I\'d like be the kind of person who\'d have to actually go and like get help if that makes sense Okay, so how do you feel about being here today? It\'s like scared. I don\'t know. Hopefully it will help. Okay, so you\'ve been feeling a little bit anxious about today. Yeah Okay, so I guess just going back to why you went to the GP and how you\'ve ended up kind of coming here today So it sounds like you\'ve been experiencing anxiety for quite a few years But just recently you moved out of home for the first time and and that was what kind of led you to go to the GP So how did that change things? How were things after you moved out? I thought that they\'d be better but because I thought I\'d have to kind of be independent and it\'s actually a lot worse I\'m just kind of staying in the house a lot. I don\'t really have any friends or anything I mean my family come and visit a bit, but it\'s not I don\'t know It\'s kind of scary because I\'ve just been kind of literally just in the flat by myself Which I always thought I\'d like but I don\'t actually like it Okay, so what other kind of difficulties that you have been experiencing and I mean, I\'m I\'m a photographer and So I kind of it\'s been stopping me a bit my anxiety from being able to get work and Because every time you know, there\'s an opportunity that is kind of involving me having to interact with people I just tend to just turn it down. So it\'s kind of making things hard in that respect and Just kind of friends wise and everything. I just feel like I\'m just kind of increasingly more alone So it\'s kind of stopping me from making friends and you know, like relationships and stuff Okay, so you said that Your difficulties are getting in the way of you doing certain things So they\'re they\'re stopping you from taking up kind of certain types of work and as a freelance photographer I guess that that can be kind of a problem and they\'re also stopping you or you feel like it\'s stunting you socially You\'re not kind of able to make new friends and get to meet new people. Yeah. Yeah And It was kind of easier when I was at home because I was obviously I mean my parents is that\'s fine But you know, they would I\'d go to places with them or I\'d kind of have people there, but more and more I\'m just finding myself just staying in a lot I mean, I went like two weeks go for coffee with my friends and the whole time I was just kind of wanting to go home again. So I don\'t I just don\'t want to I don\'t want that to happen I don\'t want to lose everyone So, so you\'re kind of worried about how where this is gonna lead to yeah Yeah So you said that you first noticed the anxiety kicking in when about five or six years ago So you would have been about 19. Yeah, and what was happening around that time? I guess I\'d finished school about a year before that And I mean I\'ve always been a bit shy at school But it was never ever Like it didn\'t really affect that things as much as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years I guess it just started when it like my friends went to university and I don\'t know I felt like I was expected to kind of move out or do something and then it just kind of Escalated from there. I just stopped going to parties or I\'d just say no to invitations or I Thought my job would help because I mean, I love it I really like doing photography, but I\'m just kind of getting less and less work as it goes on So which is my far keep saying no What kind of work is the most difficult for you and your job? I guess when it I have to kind of be working with other people and I don\'t like that it\'s like when I\'m trying to kind of Would do an event or something where there\'s a lot of people they\'re not just photographers But actually, you know from like taking phrases of people that I don\'t know I just kind of find myself saying, you know, I mean I want to do them, but Just it\'s scary. So I just don\'t do it So I just tell me a bit more about what happens then so let\'s focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with You know, it\'s gonna involve Photography with with a group of people and you\'re gonna have to have social interaction What kind of thoughts go through your head? just I mean I get really hot and sweaty and I don\'t I feel like everyone\'s kind of looking at me and thinking that I\'m just like really stupid and I feel like they\'re all gonna be staring and thinking I just can\'t do my job and I\'m just an idiot and I Mean they\'ll think that I just look like a weirdo and I just try and I mean I just kind of just try and get out of the situation or just focus on something else So that\'s why I like doing shots where it\'s just me and the camera Because I hope then I can just put all my attention on that Instead of having to you know be with other people Okay, so it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your head then at the point where you get that invitation You think People look people stare people will think I\'m a weirdo There\'s quite a lot about what you what you think other people will think. Yeah, and how does that make you feel? Just makes me feel like an idiot. It makes me feel Like I just shouldn\'t even bother trying to do it anymore I should just go home and I just I think I just don\'t want to be in that situation I just feel like everyone else is fine and they\'re normal And I\'m just the freak you can\'t like do normal things and okay Can you give me an example of a recent situation? Maybe we can focus on that Like a work situation. Yeah time when you were maybe doing a job with some people and you felt the social anxiety You know that you\'re describing you felt that kick in Yeah, I was doing a job where it was kind of like a nature shoot and I was having to work with a lot of different people and And I mean when they told me about the job, I thought it would be fine I thought it was just gonna be a few other photographers, but there were actually people and you know I was taking photos of people kind of in the trees and stuff like that And I get they asked me to him that sounds quite interesting was a fashion shoot. Yeah. Yeah, it was a fashion thing I think it was for some kind of I\'m not sure if it was a campaign or something But it was yeah, it was really cool But I find it found it really hard to try and focus on that So I was kind of feeling really anxious and so it wasn\'t what you expected No, it was no. So how long ago was that? That was two weeks ago. Okay, so it\'s quite recent Yeah, so on that particular day, what were the thoughts that you had in your head when you were in that situation? Just felt really Just really kind of hot I couldn\'t really breathe and just felt like I wanted to just get out and I was kind of trying really really hard to just Focus and just you know, like kind of hold the camera and just not think about anything But I just felt like everyone was looking at me and like when they\'d say Action and they try and get me to start and I was just felt like everyone was just thinking I was really stupid And I shouldn\'t have been there and I can tell you\'re getting kind of anxious even just thinking about that day Yeah, okay. So you\'re describing quite a lot there to me. So you\'re saying that you kind of got hot and sweaty You said that you held the camera Yeah, what was do you mean you kind of trying to hide behind it or just focus on it? I was just thinking if I could just hold it really tightly It would just I don\'t know. I\'d kind of just be able to just get through it and just You\'re holding the camera very tight. Yeah And why was that? Why was that helpful? Because I felt like I was getting really like hot and flushed and I just thought at least if I can just I don\'t know But I was just trying to keep my hands still on it because my hands were kind of sweaty and like shaking like loads I can I could just tell everyone was Looking and they could see and I just thought if I just managed to hold on to it It wouldn\'t be as noticeable but okay. So okay, so it sounds like you had a lot of thoughts going through your head He said that you worried that everyone\'s looking at you. What other thoughts were there that were in your mind? just I was just Just stupid and it was just really just felt really like kind of like everyone was just going to be staring and just thinking that I just felt like everyone was looking at me and just They could tell and just thinking or what what\'s she doing and they could tell what I was just really like sweaty and just Okay, so like that they could see that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, and so I was trying to wear black So this kind of tries to cover it up and just like a lot of layers So they can\'t tell but I mean my hands like they was so shaking I was really red and just just just wishing that I just wasn\'t there So, I mean you\'ve already described it to me a little bit But if you think about how you looked that day, how do you say how do you think you looked? I think just really stupid and like I think my face was really red I could feel it flushing and I knew that I was probably sweating and Shaking like my hands were definitely really really shaking and It was like definitely really noticeable. Everyone could definitely stay. Okay. And what what did you do about? How did you try and conceal that or hide that? Well, again, I was trying to grip the camera Just look down just trying not to do anything weird or because I mean they could probably tell I was being weird anyway but hopefully if I just tried really hard to just focus and Look down not try it and like not look at anyone else and just Yeah, just kind of try and get on with it as best as I could but so you avoided looking at people It sounds like you wore black as well. Yeah in kind of preparation in any way Yeah No I always do that even if it\'s really hot or I wear just loads of layers and just because otherwise I\'ll just be really sweaty and like People would definitely be able to see so okay. And how did it end? Well, it kind of went on for like an hour or so and then people were going and Just after every shoot people go out for drinks after just to kind of celebrate like that We\'ve done it, but I just I went home straight away. Just got in my car and went home I just didn\'t want to be around them Especially after they would have seen me being weird and I just wanted to get get home straight away Okay\n\n    请按照以下维度cleaning对话内容：\n    去除无关内容, 处理缺失和不完整数据, 数据规范化, 去除特殊字符和标点, 停用词处理, 分词和词形还原, 处理重复和冗余信息, 匿名化和隐私保护, 纠正语法和拼写错误\n\n    示例输出格式：\n    {\n        "conversations": [\n            {\n                "input": "最近我觉得自己压力很大，生活中的事情都让人喘不过气来，我经常感到很焦虑，不知道该怎么办。",\n                "output": "听起来你正经历着很大的压力，这一定让你感到很不安。能和我分享一下，是什么事情让你感到焦虑呢？"\n            },\n            {\n                "input": "用户的下一句话",\n                "output": "AI的下一句回复"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    '}], 'model': 'deepseek-chat', 'max_tokens': 4000, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.2}}

Hi. So I understand that you were referred to me by your GP because you\'ve been experiencing some anxiety difficulties. Yeah, um Yeah, I guess it kind of started like five, six years ago. Okay, um It kind of escalated a bit and I\'ve just recently moved out and from living with my parents So it\'s made it a bit worse. I think Okay, is this the first time that you\'ve left home? Yeah, I am Yeah, it\'s the first time actually. Yeah, and I was going to a few years ago. I just thought it\'d be easier to stay home So, okay, so it\'s been quite a big step and a big change and and it sounds like that So that was what led you to go to your GP. Yeah, so how has that changed things for you? Do you know it\'s kind of I haven\'t really told anyone so I mean It\'s made it like better in the sense I feel hopefully this is you know, this is it like it will it\'ll help But I don\'t know. I don\'t like thinking that I\'ve like had to do this I never thought I\'d like be the kind of person who\'d have to actually go and like get help if that makes sense Okay, so how do you feel about being here today? It\'s like scared. I don\'t know. Hopefully it will help. Okay, so you\'ve been feeling a little bit anxious about today. Yeah Okay, so I guess just going back to why you went to the GP and how you\'ve ended up kind of coming here today So it sounds like you\'ve been experiencing anxiety for quite a few years But just recently you moved out of home for the first time and and that was what kind of led you to go to the GP So how did that change things? How were things after you moved out? I thought that they\'d be better but because I thought I\'d have to kind of be independent and it\'s actually a lot worse I\'m just kind of staying in the house a lot. I don\'t really have any friends or anything I mean my family come and visit a bit, but it\'s not I don\'t know It\'s kind of scary because I\'ve just been kind of literally just in the flat by myself Which I always thought I\'d like but I don\'t actually like it Okay, so what other kind of difficulties that you have been experiencing and I mean, I\'m I\'m a photographer and So I kind of it\'s been stopping me a bit my anxiety from being able to get work and Because every time you know, there\'s an opportunity that is kind of involving me having to interact with people I just tend to just turn it down. So it\'s kind of making things hard in that respect and Just kind of friends wise and everything. I just feel like I\'m just kind of increasingly more alone So it\'s kind of stopping me from making friends and you know, like relationships and stuff Okay, so you said that Your difficulties are getting in the way of you doing certain things So they\'re they\'re stopping you from taking up kind of certain types of work and as a freelance photographer I guess that that can be kind of a problem and they\'re also stopping you or you feel like it\'s stunting you socially You\'re not kind of able to make new friends and get to meet new people. Yeah. Yeah And It was kind of easier when I was at home because I was obviously I mean my parents is that\'s fine But you know, they would I\'d go to places with them or I\'d kind of have people there, but more and more I\'m just finding myself just staying in a lot I mean, I went like two weeks go for coffee with my friends and the whole time I was just kind of wanting to go home again. So I don\'t I just don\'t want to I don\'t want that to happen I don\'t want to lose everyone So, so you\'re kind of worried about how where this is gonna lead to yeah Yeah So you said that you first noticed the anxiety kicking in when about five or six years ago So you would have been about 19. Yeah, and what was happening around that time? I guess I\'d finished school about a year before that And I mean I\'ve always been a bit shy at school But it was never ever Like it didn\'t really affect that things as much as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years I guess it just started when it like my friends went to university and I don\'t know I felt like I was expected to kind of move out or do something and then it just kind of Escalated from there. I just stopped going to parties or I\'d just say no to invitations or I Thought my job would help because I mean, I love it I really like doing photography, but I\'m just kind of getting less and less work as it goes on So which is my far keep saying no What kind of work is the most difficult for you and your job? I guess when it I have to kind of be working with other people and I don\'t like that it\'s like when I\'m trying to kind of Would do an event or something where there\'s a lot of people they\'re not just photographers But actually, you know from like taking phrases of people that I don\'t know I just kind of find myself saying, you know, I mean I want to do them, but Just it\'s scary. So I just don\'t do it So I just tell me a bit more about what happens then so let\'s focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with You know, it\'s gonna involve Photography with with a group of people and you\'re gonna have to have social interaction What kind of thoughts go through your head? just I mean I get really hot and sweaty and I don\'t I feel like everyone\'s kind of looking at me and thinking that I\'m just like really stupid and I feel like they\'re all gonna be staring and thinking I just can\'t do my job and I\'m just an idiot and I Mean they\'ll think that I just look like a weirdo and I just try and I mean I just kind of just try and get out of the situation or just focus on something else So that\'s why I like doing shots where it\'s just me and the camera Because I hope then I can just put all my attention on that Instead of having to you know be with other people Okay, so it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your head then at the point where you get that invitation You think People look people stare people will think I\'m a weirdo There\'s quite a lot about what you what you think other people will think. Yeah, and how does that make you feel? Just makes me feel like an idiot. It makes me feel Like I just shouldn\'t even bother trying to do it anymore I should just go home and I just I think I just don\'t want to be in that situation I just feel like everyone else is fine and they\'re normal And I\'m just the freak you can\'t like do normal things and okay Can you give me an example of a recent situation? Maybe we can focus on that Like a work situation. Yeah time when you were maybe doing a job with some people and you felt the social anxiety You know that you\'re describing you felt that kick in Yeah, I was doing a job where it was kind of like a nature shoot and I was having to work with a lot of different people and And I mean when they told me about the job, I thought it would be fine I thought it was just gonna be a few other photographers, but there were actually people and you know I was taking photos of people kind of in the trees and stuff like that And I get they asked me to him that sounds quite interesting was a fashion shoot. Yeah. Yeah, it was a fashion thing I think it was for some kind of I\'m not sure if it was a campaign or something But it was yeah, it was really cool But I find it found it really hard to try and focus on that So I was kind of feeling really anxious and so it wasn\'t what you expected No, it was no. So how long ago was that? That was two weeks ago. Okay, so it\'s quite recent Yeah, so on that particular day, what were the thoughts that you had in your head when you were in that situation? Just felt really Just really kind of hot I couldn\'t really breathe and just felt like I wanted to just get out and I was kind of trying really really hard to just Focus and just you know, like kind of hold the camera and just not think about anything But I just felt like everyone was looking at me and like when they\'d say Action and they try and get me to start and I was just felt like everyone was just thinking I was really stupid And I shouldn\'t have been there and I can tell you\'re getting kind of anxious even just thinking about that day Yeah, okay. So you\'re describing quite a lot there to me. So you\'re saying that you kind of got hot and sweaty You said that you held the camera Yeah, what was do you mean you kind of trying to hide behind it or just focus on it? I was just thinking if I could just hold it really tightly It would just I don\'t know. I\'d kind of just be able to just get through it and just You\'re holding the camera very tight. Yeah And why was that? Why was that helpful? Because I felt like I was getting really like hot and flushed and I just thought at least if I can just I don\'t know But I was just trying to keep my hands still on it because my hands were kind of sweaty and like shaking like loads I can I could just tell everyone was Looking and they could see and I just thought if I just managed to hold on to it It wouldn\'t be as noticeable but okay. So okay, so it sounds like you had a lot of thoughts going through your head He said that you worried that everyone\'s looking at you. What other thoughts were there that were in your mind? just I was just Just stupid and it was just really just felt really like kind of like everyone was just going to be staring and just thinking that I just felt like everyone was looking at me and just They could tell and just thinking or what what\'s she doing and they could tell what I was just really like sweaty and just Okay, so like that they could see that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, and so I was trying to wear black So this kind of tries to cover it up and just like a lot of layers So they can\'t tell but I mean my hands like they was so shaking I was really red and just just just wishing that I just wasn\'t there So, I mean you\'ve already described it to me a little bit But if you think about how you looked that day, how do you say how do you think you looked? I think just really stupid and like I think my face was really red I could feel it flushing and I knew that I was probably sweating and Shaking like my hands were definitely really really shaking and It was like definitely really noticeable. Everyone could definitely stay. Okay. And what what did you do about? How did you try and conceal that or hide that? Well, again, I was trying to grip the camera Just look down just trying not to do anything weird or because I mean they could probably tell I was being weird anyway but hopefully if I just tried really hard to just focus and Look down not try it and like not look at anyone else and just Yeah, just kind of try and get on with it as best as I could but so you avoided looking at people It sounds like you wore black as well. Yeah in kind of preparation in any way Yeah No I always do that even if it\'s really hot or I wear just loads of layers and just because otherwise I\'ll just be really sweaty and like People would definitely be able to see so okay. And how did it end? Well, it kind of went on for like an hour or so and then people were going and Just after every shoot people go out for drinks after just to kind of celebrate like that We\'ve done it, but I just I went home straight away. Just got in my car and went home I just didn\'t want to be around them Especially after they would have seen me being weird and I just wanted to get get home straight away Okay\n\n    请按照以下维度cleaning对话内容：\n    去除无关内容, 处理缺失和不完整数据, 数据规范化, 去除特殊字符和标点, 停用词处理, 分词和词形还原, 处理重复和冗余信息, 匿名化和隐私保护, 纠正语法和拼写错误\n\n    示例输出格式：\n    {\n        "conversations": [\n            {\n                "input": "最近我觉得自己压力很大，生活中的事情都让人喘不过气来，我经常感到很焦虑，不知道该怎么办。",\n                "output": "听起来你正经历着很大的压力，这一定让你感到很不安。能和我分享一下，是什么事情让你感到焦虑呢？"\n            },\n            {\n                "input": "用户的下一句话",\n                "output": "AI的下一句回复"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    '}], 'model': 'deepseek-chat', 'max_tokens': 4000, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.2}}

Yeah Okay, so I guess just going back to why you went to the GP and how you\'ve ended up kind of coming here today So it sounds like you\'ve been experiencing anxiety for quite a few years But just recently you moved out of home for the first time and and that was what kind of led you to go to the GP So how did that change things? How were things after you moved out? I thought that they\'d be better but because I thought I\'d have to kind of be independent and it\'s actually a lot worse I\'m just kind of staying in the house a lot. I don\'t really have any friends or anything I mean my family come and visit a bit, but it\'s not I don\'t know It\'s kind of scary because I\'ve just been kind of literally just in the flat by myself Which I always thought I\'d like but I don\'t actually like it Okay, so what other kind of difficulties that you have been experiencing and I mean, I\'m I\'m a photographer and So I kind of it\'s been stopping me a bit my anxiety from being able to get work and Because every time you know, there\'s an opportunity that is kind of involving me having to interact with people I just tend to just turn it down. So it\'s kind of making things hard in that respect and Just kind of friends wise and everything. I just feel like I\'m just kind of increasingly more alone So it\'s kind of stopping me from making friends and you know, like relationships and stuff Okay, so you said that Your difficulties are getting in the way of you doing certain things So they\'re they\'re stopping you from taking up kind of certain types of work and as a freelance photographer I guess that that can be kind of a problem and they\'re also stopping you or you feel like it\'s stunting you socially You\'re not kind of able to make new friends and get to meet new people. Yeah. Yeah And It was kind of easier when I was at home because I was obviously I mean my parents is that\'s fine But you know, they would I\'d go to places with them or I\'d kind of have people there, but more and more I\'m just finding myself just staying in a lot I mean, I went like two weeks go for coffee with my friends and the whole time I was just kind of wanting to go home again. So I don\'t I just don\'t want to I don\'t want that to happen I don\'t want to lose everyone So, so you\'re kind of worried about how where this is gonna lead to yeah Yeah So you said that you first noticed the anxiety kicking in when about five or six years ago So you would have been about 19. Yeah, and what was happening around that time? I guess I\'d finished school about a year before that And I mean I\'ve always been a bit shy at school But it was never ever Like it didn\'t really affect that things as much as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years I guess it just started when it like my friends went to university and I don\'t know I felt like I was expected to kind of move out or do something and then it just kind of Escalated from there. I just stopped going to parties or I\'d just say no to invitations or I Thought my job would help because I mean, I love it I really like doing photography, but I\'m just kind of getting less and less work as it goes on So which is my far keep saying no What kind of work is the most difficult for you and your job? I guess when it I have to kind of be working with other people and I don\'t like that it\'s like when I\'m trying to kind of Would do an event or something where there\'s a lot of people they\'re not just photographers But actually, you know from like taking phrases of people that I don\'t know I just kind of find myself saying, you know, I mean I want to do them, but Just it\'s scary. So I just don\'t do it So I just tell me a bit more about what happens then so let\'s focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with You know, it\'s gonna involve Photography with with a group of people and you\'re gonna have to have social interaction What kind of thoughts go through your head? just I mean I get really hot and sweaty and I don\'t I feel like everyone\'s kind of looking at me and thinking that I\'m just like really stupid and I feel like they\'re all gonna be staring and thinking I just can\'t do my job and I\'m just an idiot and I Mean they\'ll think that I just look like a weirdo and I just try and I mean I just kind of just try and get out of the situation or just focus on something else So that\'s why I like doing shots where it\'s just me and the camera Because I hope then I can just put all my attention on that Instead of having to you know be with other people Okay, so it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your head then at the point where you get that invitation You think People look people stare people will think I\'m a weirdo There\'s quite a lot about what you what you think other people will think. Yeah, and how does that make you feel? Just makes me feel like an idiot. It makes me feel Like I just shouldn\'t even bother trying to do it anymore I should just go home and I just I think I just don\'t want to be in that situation I just feel like everyone else is fine and they\'re normal And I\'m just the freak you can\'t like do normal things and okay Can you give me an example of a recent situation? Maybe we can focus on that Like a work situation. Yeah time when you were maybe doing a job with some people and you felt the social anxiety You know that you\'re describing you felt that kick in Yeah, I was doing a job where it was kind of like a nature shoot and I was having to work with a lot of different people and And I mean when they told me about the job, I thought it would be fine I thought it was just gonna be a few other photographers, but there were actually people and you know I was taking photos of people kind of in the trees and stuff like that And I get they asked me to him that sounds quite interesting was a fashion shoot. Yeah. Yeah, it was a fashion thing I think it was for some kind of I\'m not sure if it was a campaign or something But it was yeah, it was really cool But I find it found it really hard to try and focus on that So I was kind of feeling really anxious and so it wasn\'t what you expected No, it was no. So how long ago was that? That was two weeks ago. Okay, so it\'s quite recent Yeah, so on that particular day, what were the thoughts that you had in your head when you were in that situation? Just felt really Just really kind of hot I couldn\'t really breathe and just felt like I wanted to just get out and I was kind of trying really really hard to just Focus and just you know, like kind of hold the camera and just not think about anything But I just felt like everyone was looking at me and like when they\'d say Action and they try and get me to start and I was just felt like everyone was just thinking I was really stupid And I shouldn\'t have been there and I can tell you\'re getting kind of anxious even just thinking about that day Yeah, okay. So you\'re describing quite a lot there to me. So you\'re saying that you kind of got hot and sweaty You said that you held the camera Yeah, what was do you mean you kind of trying to hide behind it or just focus on it? I was just thinking if I could just hold it really tightly It would just I don\'t know. I\'d kind of just be able to just get through it and just You\'re holding the camera very tight. Yeah And why was that? Why was that helpful? Because I felt like I was getting really like hot and flushed and I just thought at least if I can just I don\'t know But I was just trying to keep my hands still on it because my hands were kind of sweaty and like shaking like loads I can I could just tell everyone was Looking and they could see and I just thought if I just managed to hold on to it It wouldn\'t be as noticeable but okay. So okay, so it sounds like you had a lot of thoughts going through your head He said that you worried that everyone\'s looking at you. What other thoughts were there that were in your mind? just I was just Just stupid and it was just really just felt really like kind of like everyone was just going to be staring and just thinking that I just felt like everyone was looking at me and just They could tell and just thinking or what what\'s she doing and they could tell what I was just really like sweaty and just Okay, so like that they could see that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, and so I was trying to wear black So this kind of tries to cover it up and just like a lot of layers So they can\'t tell but I mean my hands like they was so shaking I was really red and just just just wishing that I just wasn\'t there So, I mean you\'ve already described it to me a little bit But if you think about how you looked that day, how do you say how do you think you looked? I think just really stupid and like I think my face was really red I could feel it flushing and I knew that I was probably sweating and Shaking like my hands were definitely really really shaking and It was like definitely really noticeable. Everyone could definitely stay. Okay. And what what did you do about? How did you try and conceal that or hide that? Well, again, I was trying to grip the camera Just look down just trying not to do anything weird or because I mean they could probably tell I was being weird anyway but hopefully if I just tried really hard to just focus and Look down not try it and like not look at anyone else and just Yeah, just kind of try and get on with it as best as I could but so you avoided looking at people It sounds like you wore black as well. Yeah in kind of preparation in any way Yeah No I always do that even if it\'s really hot or I wear just loads of layers and just because otherwise I\'ll just be really sweaty and like People would definitely be able to see so okay. And how did it end? Well, it kind of went on for like an hour or so and then people were going and Just after every shoot people go out for drinks after just to kind of celebrate like that We\'ve done it, but I just I went home straight away. Just got in my car and went home I just didn\'t want to be around them Especially after they would have seen me being weird and I just wanted to get get home straight away Okay\n\n    请按照以下维度cleaning对话内容：\n    去除无关内容, 处理缺失和不完整数据, 数据规范化, 去除特殊字符和标点, 停用词处理, 分词和词形还原, 处理重复和冗余信息, 匿名化和隐私保护, 纠正语法和拼写错误\n\n    示例输出格式：\n    {\n        "conversations": [\n            {\n                "input": "最近我觉得自己压力很大，生活中的事情都让人喘不过气来，我经常感到很焦虑，不知道该怎么办。",\n                "output": "听起来你正经历着很大的压力，这一定让你感到很不安。能和我分享一下，是什么事情让你感到焦虑呢？"\n            },\n            {\n                "input": "用户的下一句话",\n                "output": "AI的下一句回复"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    '}], 'model': 'deepseek-chat', 'max_tokens': 4000, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.2}}

Hi. So I understand that you were referred to me by your GP because you\'ve been experiencing some anxiety difficulties. Yeah, um Yeah, I guess it kind of started like five, six years ago. Okay, um It kind of escalated a bit and I\'ve just recently moved out and from living with my parents So it\'s made it a bit worse. I think Okay, is this the first time that you\'ve left home? Yeah, I am Yeah, it\'s the first time actually. Yeah, and I was going to a few years ago. I just thought it\'d be easier to stay home So, okay, so it\'s been quite a big step and a big change and and it sounds like that So that was what led you to go to your GP. Yeah, so how has that changed things for you? Do you know it\'s kind of I haven\'t really told anyone so I mean It\'s made it like better in the sense I feel hopefully this is you know, this is it like it will it\'ll help But I don\'t know. I don\'t like thinking that I\'ve like had to do this I never thought I\'d like be the kind of person who\'d have to actually go and like get help if that makes sense Okay, so how do you feel about being here today? It\'s like scared. I don\'t know. Hopefully it will help. Okay, so you\'ve been feeling a little bit anxious about today. Yeah Okay, so I guess just going back to why you went to the GP and how you\'ve ended up kind of coming here today So it sounds like you\'ve been experiencing anxiety for quite a few years But just recently you moved out of home for the first time and and that was what kind of led you to go to the GP So how did that change things? How were things after you moved out? I thought that they\'d be better but because I thought I\'d have to kind of be independent and it\'s actually a lot worse I\'m just kind of staying in the house a lot. I don\'t really have any friends or anything I mean my family come and visit a bit, but it\'s not I don\'t know It\'s kind of scary because I\'ve just been kind of literally just in the flat by myself Which I always thought I\'d like but I don\'t actually like it Okay, so what other kind of difficulties that you have been experiencing and I mean, I\'m I\'m a photographer and So I kind of it\'s been stopping me a bit my anxiety from being able to get work and Because every time you know, there\'s an opportunity that is kind of involving me having to interact with people I just tend to just turn it down. So it\'s kind of making things hard in that respect and Just kind of friends wise and everything. I just feel like I\'m just kind of increasingly more alone So it\'s kind of stopping me from making friends and you know, like relationships and stuff Okay, so you said that Your difficulties are getting in the way of you doing certain things So they\'re they\'re stopping you from taking up kind of certain types of work and as a freelance photographer I guess that that can be kind of a problem and they\'re also stopping you or you feel like it\'s stunting you socially You\'re not kind of able to make new friends and get to meet new people. Yeah. Yeah And It was kind of easier when I was at home because I was obviously I mean my parents is that\'s fine But you know, they would I\'d go to places with them or I\'d kind of have people there, but more and more I\'m just finding myself just staying in a lot I mean, I went like two weeks go for coffee with my friends and the whole time I was just kind of wanting to go home again. So I don\'t I just don\'t want to I don\'t want that to happen I don\'t want to lose everyone So, so you\'re kind of worried about how where this is gonna lead to yeah Yeah So you said that you first noticed the anxiety kicking in when about five or six years ago So you would have been about 19. Yeah, and what was happening around that time? I guess I\'d finished school about a year before that And I mean I\'ve always been a bit shy at school But it was never ever Like it didn\'t really affect that things as much as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years I guess it just started when it like my friends went to university and I don\'t know I felt like I was expected to kind of move out or do something and then it just kind of Escalated from there. I just stopped going to parties or I\'d just say no to invitations or I Thought my job would help because I mean, I love it I really like doing photography, but I\'m just kind of getting less and less work as it goes on So which is my far keep saying no What kind of work is the most difficult for you and your job? I guess when it I have to kind of be working with other people and I don\'t like that it\'s like when I\'m trying to kind of Would do an event or something where there\'s a lot of people they\'re not just photographers But actually, you know from like taking phrases of people that I don\'t know I just kind of find myself saying, you know, I mean I want to do them, but Just it\'s scary. So I just don\'t do it So I just tell me a bit more about what happens then so let\'s focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with You know, it\'s gonna involve Photography with with a group of people and you\'re gonna have to have social interaction What kind of thoughts go through your head? just I mean I get really hot and sweaty and I don\'t I feel like everyone\'s kind of looking at me and thinking that I\'m just like really stupid and I feel like they\'re all gonna be staring and thinking I just can\'t do my job and I\'m just an idiot and I Mean they\'ll think that I just look like a weirdo and I just try and I mean I just kind of just try and get out of the situation or just focus on something else So that\'s why I like doing shots where it\'s just me and the camera Because I hope then I can just put all my attention on that Instead of having to you know be with other people Okay, so it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your head then at the point where you get that invitation You think People look people stare people will think I\'m a weirdo There\'s quite a lot about what you what you think other people will think.

Hi. So I understand that you were referred to me by your GP because you\'ve been experiencing some anxiety difficulties. Yeah, um Yeah, I guess it kind of started like five, six years ago. Okay, um It kind of escalated a bit and I\'ve just recently moved out and from living with my parents So it\'s made it a bit worse. I think Okay, is this the first time that you\'ve left home? Yeah, I am Yeah, it\'s the first time actually. Yeah, and I was going to a few years ago. I just thought it\'d be easier to stay home So, okay, so it\'s been quite a big step and a big change and and it sounds like that So that was what led you to go to your GP. Yeah, so how has that changed things for you? Do you know it\'s kind of I haven\'t really told anyone so I mean It\'s made it like better in the sense I feel hopefully this is you know, this is it like it will it\'ll help But I don\'t know. I don\'t like thinking that I\'ve like had to do this I never thought I\'d like be the kind of person who\'d have to actually go and like get help if that makes sense Okay, so how do you feel about being here today? It\'s like scared. I don\'t know. Hopefully it will help. Okay, so you\'ve been feeling a little bit anxious about today. Yeah Okay, so I guess just going back to why you went to the GP and how you\'ve ended up kind of coming here today So it sounds like you\'ve been experiencing anxiety for quite a few years But just recently you moved out of home for the first time and and that was what kind of led you to go to the GP So how did that change things? How were things after you moved out? I thought that they\'d be better but because I thought I\'d have to kind of be independent and it\'s actually a lot worse I\'m just kind of staying in the house a lot. I don\'t really have any friends or anything I mean my family come and visit a bit, but it\'s not I don\'t know It\'s kind of scary because I\'ve just been kind of literally just in the flat by myself Which I always thought I\'d like but I don\'t actually like it Okay, so what other kind of difficulties that you have been experiencing and I mean, I\'m I\'m a photographer and So I kind of it\'s been stopping me a bit my anxiety from being able to get work and Because every time you know, there\'s an opportunity that is kind of involving me having to interact with people I just tend to just turn it down. So it\'s kind of making things hard in that respect and Just kind of friends wise and everything. I just feel like I\'m just kind of increasingly more alone So it\'s kind of stopping me from making friends and you know, like relationships and stuff Okay, so you said that Your difficulties are getting in the way of you doing certain things So they\'re they\'re stopping you from taking up kind of certain types of work and as a freelance photographer I guess that that can be kind of a problem and they\'re also stopping you or you feel like it\'s stunting you socially You\'re not kind of able to make new friends and get to meet new people. Yeah. Yeah And It was kind of easier when I was at home because I was obviously I mean my parents is that\'s fine But you know, they would I\'d go to places with them or I\'d kind of have people there, but more and more I\'m just finding myself just staying in a lot I mean, I went like two weeks go for coffee with my friends and the whole time I was just kind of wanting to go home again. So I don\'t I just don\'t want to I don\'t want that to happen I don\'t want to lose everyone So, so you\'re kind of worried about how where this is gonna lead to yeah Yeah So you said that you first noticed the anxiety kicking in when about five or six years ago So you would have been about 19. Yeah, and what was happening around that time? I guess I\'d finished school about a year before that And I mean I\'ve always been a bit shy at school But it was never ever Like it didn\'t really affect that things as much as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years I guess it just started when it like my friends went to university and I don\'t know I felt like I was expected to kind of move out or do something and then it just kind of Escalated from there. I just stopped going to parties or I\'d just say no to invitations or I Thought my job would help because I mean, I love it I really like doing photography, but I\'m just kind of getting less and less work as it goes on So which is my far keep saying no What kind of work is the most difficult for you and your job? I guess when it I have to kind of be working with other people and I don\'t like that it\'s like when I\'m trying to kind of Would do an event or something where there\'s a lot of people they\'re not just photographers But actually, you know from like taking phrases of people that I don\'t know I just kind of find myself saying, you know, I mean I want to do them, but Just it\'s scary. So I just don\'t do it So I just tell me a bit more about what happens then so let\'s focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with You know, it\'s gonna involve Photography with with a group of people and you\'re gonna have to have social interaction What kind of thoughts go through your head? just I mean I get really hot and sweaty and I don\'t I feel like everyone\'s kind of looking at me and thinking that I\'m just like really stupid and I feel like they\'re all gonna be staring and thinking I just can\'t do my job and I\'m just an idiot and I Mean they\'ll think that I just look like a weirdo and I just try and I mean I just kind of just try and get out of the situation or just focus on something else So that\'s why I like doing shots where it\'s just me and the camera Because I hope then I can just put all my attention on that Instead of having to you know be with other people Okay, so it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your head then at the point where you get that invitation You think People look people stare people will think I\'m a weirdo There\'s quite a lot about what you what you think other people will think. Yeah, and how does that make you feel? Just makes me feel like an idiot. It makes me feel Like I just shouldn\'t even bother trying to do it anymore I should just go home and I just I think I just don\'t want to be in that situation I just feel like everyone else is fine and they\'re normal And I\'m just the freak you can\'t like do normal things and okay Can you give me an example of a recent situation? Maybe we can focus on that Like a work situation. Yeah time when you were maybe doing a job with some people and you felt the social anxiety You know that you\'re describing you felt that kick in Yeah, I was doing a job where it was kind of like a nature shoot and I was having to work with a lot of different people and And I mean when they told me about the job, I thought it would be fine I thought it was just gonna be a few other photographers, but there were actually people and you know I was taking photos of people kind of in the trees and stuff like that And I get they asked me to him that sounds quite interesting was a fashion shoot. Yeah. Yeah, it was a fashion thing I think it was for some kind of I\'m not sure if it was a campaign or something But it was yeah, it was really cool But I find it found it really hard to try and focus on that So I was kind of feeling really anxious and so it wasn\'t what you expected No, it was no. So how long ago was that? That was two weeks ago. Okay, so it\'s quite recent Yeah, so on that particular day, what were the thoughts that you had in your head when you were in that situation? Just felt really Just really kind of hot I couldn\'t really breathe and just felt like I wanted to just get out and I was kind of trying really really hard to just Focus and just you know, like kind of hold the camera and just not think about anything But I just felt like everyone was looking at me and like when they\'d say Action and they try and get me to start and I was just felt like everyone was just thinking I was really stupid And I shouldn\'t have been there and I can tell you\'re getting kind of anxious even just thinking about that day Yeah, okay. So you\'re describing quite a lot there to me. So you\'re saying that you kind of got hot and sweaty You said that you held the camera Yeah, what was do you mean you kind of trying to hide behind it or just focus on it? I was just thinking if I could just hold it really tightly It would just I don\'t know. I\'d kind of just be able to just get through it and just You\'re holding the camera very tight. Yeah And why was that? Why was that helpful? Because I felt like I was getting really like hot and flushed and I just thought at least if I can just I don\'t know But I was just trying to keep my hands still on it because my hands were kind of sweaty and like shaking like loads I can I could just tell everyone was Looking and they could see and I just thought if I just managed to hold on to it It wouldn\'t be as noticeable but okay. So okay, so it sounds like you had a lot of thoughts going through your head He said that you worried that everyone\'s looking at you. What other thoughts were there that were in your mind? just I was just Just stupid and it was just really just felt really like kind of like everyone was just going to be staring and just thinking that I just felt like everyone was looking at me and just They could tell and just thinking or what what\'s she doing and they could tell what I was just really like sweaty and just Okay, so like that they could see that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, and so I was trying to wear black So this kind of tries to cover it up and just like a lot of layers So they can\'t tell but I mean my hands like they was so shaking I was really red and just just just wishing that I just wasn\'t there So, I mean you\'ve already described it to me a little bit But if you think about how you looked that day, how do you say how do you think you looked? I think just really stupid and like I think my face was really red I could feel it flushing and I knew that I was probably sweating and Shaking like my hands were definitely really really shaking and It was like definitely really noticeable. Everyone could definitely stay. Okay. And what what did you do about? How did you try and conceal that or hide that? Well, again, I was trying to grip the camera Just look down just trying not to do anything weird or because I mean they could probably tell I was being weird anyway but hopefully if I just tried really hard to just focus and Look down not try it and like not look at anyone else and just Yeah, just kind of try and get on with it as best as I could but so you avoided looking at people It sounds like you wore black as well. Yeah in kind of preparation in any way Yeah No I always do that even if it\'s really hot or I wear just loads of layers and just because otherwise I\'ll just be really sweaty and like People would definitely be able to see so okay. And how did it end? Well, it kind of went on for like an hour or so and then people were going and Just after every shoot people go out for drinks after just to kind of celebrate like that We\'ve done it, but I just I went home straight away. Just got in my car and went home I just didn\'t want to be around them Especially after they would have seen me being weird and I just wanted to get get home straight away Okay\n\n    请按照以下维度cleaning对话内容：\n    去除无关内容, 处理缺失和不完整数据, 数据规范化, 去除特殊字符和标点, 停用词处理, 分词和词形还原, 处理重复和冗余信息, 匿名化和隐私保护, 纠正语法和拼写错误\n\n    示例输出格式：\n    {\n        "conversations": [\n            {\n                "input": "最近我觉得自己压力很大，生活中的事情都让人喘不过气来，我经常感到很焦虑，不知道该怎么办。",\n                "output": "听起来你正经历着很大的压力，这一定让你感到很不安。能和我分享一下，是什么事情让你感到焦虑呢？"\n            },\n            {\n                "input": "用户的下一句话",\n                "output": "AI的下一句回复"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    '}], 'model': 'deepseek-chat', 'max_tokens': 4000, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.2}}

Hi. So I understand that you were referred to me by your GP because you\'ve been experiencing some anxiety difficulties. Yeah, um Yeah, I guess it kind of started like five, six years ago. Okay, um It kind of escalated a bit and I\'ve just recently moved out and from living with my parents So it\'s made it a bit worse. I think Okay, is this the first time that you\'ve left home? Yeah, I am Yeah, it\'s the first time actually. Yeah, and I was going to a few years ago. I just thought it\'d be easier to stay home So, okay, so it\'s been quite a big step and a big change and and it sounds like that So that was what led you to go to your GP. Yeah, so how has that changed things for you? Do you know it\'s kind of I haven\'t really told anyone so I mean It\'s made it like better in the sense I feel hopefully this is you know, this is it like it will it\'ll help But I don\'t know. I don\'t like thinking that I\'ve like had to do this I never thought I\'d like be the kind of person who\'d have to actually go and like get help if that makes sense Okay, so how do you feel about being here today? It\'s like scared. I don\'t know. Hopefully it will help. Okay, so you\'ve been feeling a little bit anxious about today. Yeah Okay, so I guess just going back to why you went to the GP and how you\'ve ended up kind of coming here today So it sounds like you\'ve been experiencing anxiety for quite a few years But just recently you moved out of home for the first time and and that was what kind of led you to go to the GP So how did that change things? How were things after you moved out? I thought that they\'d be better but because I thought I\'d have to kind of be independent and it\'s actually a lot worse I\'m just kind of staying in the house a lot. I don\'t really have any friends or anything I mean my family come and visit a bit, but it\'s not I don\'t know It\'s kind of scary because I\'ve just been kind of literally just in the flat by myself Which I always thought I\'d like but I don\'t actually like it Okay, so what other kind of difficulties that you have been experiencing and I mean, I\'m I\'m a photographer and So I kind of it\'s been stopping me a bit my anxiety from being able to get work and Because every time you know, there\'s an opportunity that is kind of involving me having to interact with people I just tend to just turn it down. So it\'s kind of making things hard in that respect and Just kind of friends wise and everything. I just feel like I\'m just kind of increasingly more alone So it\'s kind of stopping me from making friends and you know, like relationships and stuff Okay, so you said that Your difficulties are getting in the way of you doing certain things So they\'re they\'re stopping you from taking up kind of certain types of work and as a freelance photographer I guess that that can be kind of a problem and they\'re also stopping you or you feel like it\'s stunting you socially You\'re not kind of able to make new friends and get to meet new people. Yeah. Yeah And It was kind of easier when I was at home because I was obviously I mean my parents is that\'s fine But you know, they would I\'d go to places with them or I\'d kind of have people there, but more and more I\'m just finding myself just staying in a lot I mean, I went like two weeks go for coffee with my friends and the whole time I was just kind of wanting to go home again. So I don\'t I just don\'t want to I don\'t want that to happen I don\'t want to lose everyone So, so you\'re kind of worried about how where this is gonna lead to yeah Yeah So you said that you first noticed the anxiety kicking in when about five or six years ago So you would have been about 19. Yeah, and what was happening around that time? I guess I\'d finished school about a year before that And I mean I\'ve always been a bit shy at school But it was never ever Like it didn\'t really affect that things as much as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years I guess it just started when it like my friends went to university and I don\'t know I felt like I was expected to kind of move out or do something and then it just kind of Escalated from there. I just stopped going to parties or I\'d just say no to invitations or I Thought my job would help because I mean, I love it I really like doing photography, but I\'m just kind of getting less and less work as it goes on So which is my far keep saying no What kind of work is the most difficult for you and your job? I guess when it I have to kind of be working with other people and I don\'t like that it\'s like when I\'m trying to kind of Would do an event or something where there\'s a lot of people they\'re not just photographers But actually, you know from like taking phrases of people that I don\'t know I just kind of find myself saying, you know, I mean I want to do them, but Just it\'s scary. So I just don\'t do it So I just tell me a bit more about what happens then so let\'s focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with You know, it\'s gonna involve Photography with with a group of people and you\'re gonna have to have social interaction What kind of thoughts go through your head? just I mean I get really hot and sweaty and I don\'t I feel like everyone\'s kind of looking at me and thinking that I\'m just like really stupid and I feel like they\'re all gonna be staring and thinking I just can\'t do my job and I\'m just an idiot and I Mean they\'ll think that I just look like a weirdo and I just try and I mean I just kind of just try and get out of the situation or just focus on something else So that\'s why I like doing shots where it\'s just me and the camera Because I hope then I can just put all my attention on that Instead of having to you know be with other people Okay, so it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your head then at the point where you get that invitation You think People look people stare people will think I\'m a weirdo There\'s quite a lot about what you what you think other people will think. Yeah, and how does that make you feel? Just makes me feel like an idiot. It makes me feel Like I just shouldn\'t even bother trying to do it anymore I should just go home and I just I think I just don\'t want to be in that situation I just feel like everyone else is fine and they\'re normal And I\'m just the freak you can\'t like do normal things and okay Can you give me an example of a recent situation? Maybe we can focus on that Like a work situation. Yeah time when you were maybe doing a job with some people and you felt the social anxiety You know that you\'re describing you felt that kick in Yeah, I was doing a job where it was kind of like a nature shoot and I was having to work with a lot of different people and And I mean when they told me about the job, I thought it would be fine I thought it was just gonna be a few other photographers, but there were actually people and you know I was taking photos of people kind of in the trees and stuff like that And I get they asked me to him that sounds quite interesting was a fashion shoot. Yeah. Yeah, it was a fashion thing I think it was for some kind of I\'m not sure if it was a campaign or something But it was yeah, it was really cool But I find it found it really hard to try and focus on that So I was kind of feeling really anxious and so it wasn\'t what you expected No, it was no. So how long ago was that? That was two weeks ago. Okay, so it\'s quite recent Yeah, so on that particular day, what were the thoughts that you had in your head when you were in that situation? Just felt really Just really kind of hot I couldn\'t really breathe and just felt like I wanted to just get out and I was kind of trying really really hard to just Focus and just you know, like kind of hold the camera and just not think about anything But I just felt like everyone was looking at me and like when they\'d say Action and they try and get me to start and I was just felt like everyone was just thinking I was really stupid And I shouldn\'t have been there and I can tell you\'re getting kind of anxious even just thinking about that day Yeah, okay. So you\'re describing quite a lot there to me. So you\'re saying that you kind of got hot and sweaty You said that you held the camera Yeah, what was do you mean you kind of trying to hide behind it or just focus on it? I was just thinking if I could just hold it really tightly It would just I don\'t know. I\'d kind of just be able to just get through it and just You\'re holding the camera very tight. Yeah And why was that? Why was that helpful? Because I felt like I was getting really like hot and flushed and I just thought at least if I can just I don\'t know But I was just trying to keep my hands still on it because my hands were kind of sweaty and like shaking like loads I can I could just tell everyone was Looking and they could see and I just thought if I just managed to hold on to it It wouldn\'t be as noticeable but okay. So okay, so it sounds like you had a lot of thoughts going through your head He said that you worried that everyone\'s looking at you. What other thoughts were there that were in your mind? just I was just Just stupid and it was just really just felt really like kind of like everyone was just going to be staring and just thinking that I just felt like everyone was looking at me and just They could tell and just thinking or what what\'s she doing and they could tell what I was just really like sweaty and just Okay, so like that they could see that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, and so I was trying to wear black So this kind of tries to cover it up and just like a lot of layers So they can\'t tell but I mean my hands like they was so shaking I was really red and just just just wishing that I just wasn\'t there So, I mean you\'ve already described it to me a little bit But if you think about how you looked that day, how do you say how do you think you looked? I think just really stupid and like I think my face was really red I could feel it flushing and I knew that I was probably sweating and Shaking like my hands were definitely really really shaking and It was like definitely really noticeable. Everyone could definitely stay. Okay. And what what did you do about? How did you try and conceal that or hide that? Well, again, I was trying to grip the camera Just look down just trying not to do anything weird or because I mean they could probably tell I was being weird anyway but hopefully if I just tried really hard to just focus and Look down not try it and like not look at anyone else and just Yeah, just kind of try and get on with it as best as I could but so you avoided looking at people It sounds like you wore black as well. Yeah in kind of preparation in any way Yeah No I always do that even if it\'s really hot or I wear just loads of layers and just because otherwise I\'ll just be really sweaty and like People would definitely be able to see so okay. And how did it end? Well, it kind of went on for like an hour or so and then people were going and Just after every shoot people go out for drinks after just to kind of celebrate like that We\'ve done it, but I just I went home straight away. Just got in my car and went home I just didn\'t want to be around them Especially after they would have seen me being weird and I just wanted to get get home straight away Okay\n\n    请按照以下维度cleaning对话内容：\n    去除无关内容, 处理缺失和不完整数据, 数据规范化, 去除特殊字符和标点, 停用词处理, 分词和词形还原, 处理重复和冗余信息, 匿名化和隐私保护, 纠正语法和拼写错误\n\n    示例输出格式：\n    {\n        "conversations": [\n            {\n                "input": "最近我觉得自己压力很大，生活中的事情都让人喘不过气来，我经常感到很焦虑，不知道该怎么办。",\n                "output": "听起来你正经历着很大的压力，这一定让你感到很不安。能和我分享一下，是什么事情让你感到焦虑呢？"\n            },\n            {\n                "input": "用户的下一句话",\n                "output": "AI的下一句回复"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    '}], 'model': 'deepseek-chat', 'max_tokens': 4000, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.2}}

I just stopped going to parties or I'd just say no to invitations or I Thought my job would help because I mean, I love it I really like doing photography, but I'm just kind of getting less and less work as it goes on So which is my far keep saying no What kind of work is the most difficult for you and your job? I guess when it I have to kind of be working with other people and I don't like that it's like when I'm trying to kind of Would do an event or something where there's a lot of people they're not just photographers But actually, you know from like taking phrases of people that I don't know I just kind of find myself saying, you know, I mean I want to do them, but Just it's scary. So I just don't do it So I just tell me a bit more about what happens then so let's focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with You know, it's gonna involve Photography with with a group of people and you're gonna have to have social interaction What kind of thoughts go through your head? just I mean I get really hot and sweaty and I don't I feel like everyone's kind of looking at me and thinking that I'm just like really stupid and I feel like they're all gonna be staring and thinking I just can't do my job and I'm just an idiot and I Mean they'll think that I just look like a weirdo and I just try and I mean I just kind of just try and get out of the situation or just focus on something else So that's why I like doing shots where it's just me and the camera Because I hope then I can just put all my attention on that Instead of having to you know be with other people Okay, so it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your head then at the point where you get that invitation You think People look people stare people will think I'm a weirdo There's quite a lot about what you what you think other people will think. Yeah, and how does that make you feel? Just makes me feel like an idiot. It makes me feel Like I just shouldn't even bother trying to do it anymore I should just go home and I just I think I just don't want to be in that situation I just feel like everyone else is fine and they're normal And I'm just the freak you can't like do normal things and okay Can you give me an example of a recent situation? Maybe we can focus on that Like a work situation. Yeah time when you were maybe doing a job with some people and you felt the social anxiety You know that you're describing you felt that kick in Yeah, I was doing a job where it was kind of like a nature shoot and I was having to work with a lot of different people and And I mean when they told me about the job, I thought it would be fine I thought it was just gonna be a few other photographers, but there were actually people and you know I was taking photos of people kind of in the trees and stuff like that And I get they asked me to him that sounds quite interesting was a fashion shoot. Yeah. Yeah, it was a fashion thing I think it was for some kind of I'm not sure if it was a campaign or something But it was yeah, it was really cool But I find it found it really hard to try and focus on that So I was kind of feeling really anxious and so it wasn't what you expected No, it was no. So how long ago was that? That was two weeks ago. Okay, so it's quite recent Yeah, so on that particular day, what were the thoughts that you had in your head when you were in that situation? Just felt really Just really kind of hot I couldn't really breathe and just felt like I wanted to just get out and I was kind of trying really really hard to just Focus and just you know, like kind of hold the camera and just not think about anything But I just felt like everyone was looking at me and like when they'd say Action and they try and get me to start and I was just felt like everyone was just thinking I was really stupid And I shouldn't have been there and I can tell you're getting kind of anxious even just thinking about that day Yeah, okay. So you're describing quite a lot there to me. So you're saying that you kind of got hot and sweaty You said that you held the camera Yeah, what was do you mean you kind of trying to hide behind it or just focus on it? I was just thinking if I could just hold it really tightly It would just I don't know. I'd kind of just be able to just get through it and just You're holding the camera very tight. Yeah And why was that? Why was that helpful? Because I felt like I was getting really like hot and flushed and I just thought at least if I can just I don't know But I was just trying to keep my hands still on it because my hands were kind of sweaty and like shaking like loads I can I could just tell everyone was Looking and they could see and I just thought if I just managed to hold on to it It wouldn't be as noticeable but okay. So okay, so it sounds like you had a lot of thoughts going through your head He said that you worried that everyone's looking at you. What other thoughts were there that were in your mind? just I was just Just stupid and it was just really just felt really like kind of like everyone was just going to be staring and just thinking that I just felt like everyone was looking at me and just They could tell and just thinking or what what's she doing and they could tell what I was just really like sweaty and just Okay, so like that they could see that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, and so I was trying to wear black So this kind of tries to cover it up and just like a lot of layers So they can't tell but I mean my hands like they was so shaking I was really red and just just just wishing that I just wasn't there So, I mean you've already described it to me a little bit But if you think about how you looked that day, how do you say how do you think you looked? I think just really stupid and like I think my face was really red I could feel it flushing and I knew that I was probably sweating and Shaking like my hands were definitely really really shaking and It was like definitely really noticeable. Everyone could definitely stay. Okay. And what what did you do about? How did you try and conceal that or hide that? Well, again, I was trying to grip the camera Just look down just trying not to do anything weird or because I mean they could probably tell I was being weird anyway but hopefully if I just tried really hard to just focus and Look down not try it and like not look at anyone else and just Yeah, just kind of try and get on with it as best as I could but so you avoided looking at people It sounds like you wore black as well. Yeah in kind of preparation in any way Yeah No I always do that even if it's really hot or I wear just loads of layers and just because otherwise I'll just be really sweaty and like People would definitely be able to see so okay. And how did it end? Well, it kind of went on for like an hour or so and then people were going and Just after every shoot people go out for drinks after just to kind of celebrate like that We've done it, but I just I went home straight away. Just got in my car and went home I just didn't want to be around them Especially after they would have seen me being weird and I just wanted to get get home straight away Okay",

I think Okay, is this the first time that you've left home?", 'output': "Yeah, I am Yeah, it's the first time actually."}, {'input': "Yeah, and I was going to a few years ago. I just thought it'd be easier to stay home So, okay, so it's been quite a big step and a big change and and it sounds like that So that was what led you to go to your GP.", 'output': 'Yeah, so how has that changed things for you?'}, {'input': "Do you know it's kind of I haven't really told anyone so I mean It's made it like better in the sense I feel hopefully this is you know, this is it like it will it'll help But I don't know. I don't like thinking that I've like had to do this I never thought I'd like be the kind of person who'd have to actually go and like get help if that makes sense", 'output': 'Okay, so how do you feel about being here today?'}, {'input': "It's like scared. I don't know. Hopefully it will help.", 'output': "Okay, so you've been feeling a little bit anxious about today."}, {'input': "Yeah Okay, so I guess just going back to why you went to the GP and how you've ended up kind of coming here today So it sounds like you've been experiencing anxiety for quite a few years But just recently you moved out of home for the first time and and that was what kind of led you to go to the GP So how did that change things? How were things after you moved out?", 'output': "I thought that they'd be better but because I thought I'd have to kind of be independent and it's actually a lot worse I'm just kind of staying in the house a lot."}, {'input': "I don't really have any friends or anything I mean my family come and visit a bit, but it's not I don't know It's kind of scary because I've just been kind of literally just in the flat by myself Which I always thought I'd like but I don't actually like it Okay, so what other kind of difficulties that you have been experiencing and I mean, I'm I'm a photographer and So I kind of it's been stopping me a bit my anxiety from being able to get work and Because every time you know, there's an opportunity that is kind of involving me having to interact with people I just tend to just turn it down. So it's kind of making things hard in that respect and Just kind of friends wise and everything. I just feel like I'm just kind of increasingly more alone So it's kind of stopping me from making friends and you know, like relationships and stuff", 'output': "Okay, so you said that Your difficulties are getting in the way of you doing certain things So they're they're stopping you from taking up kind of certain types of work and as a freelance photographer I guess that that can be kind of a problem and they're also stopping you or you feel like it's stunting you socially You're not kind of able to make new friends and get to meet new people."}, {'input': "Yeah. Yeah And It was kind of easier when I was at home because I was obviously I mean my parents is that's fine But you know, they would I'd go to places with them or I'd kind of have people there, but more and more I'm just finding myself just staying in a lot I mean, I went like two weeks go for coffee with my friends and the whole time I was just kind of wanting to go home again. So I don't I just don't want to I don't want that to happen I don't want to lose everyone So, so you're kind of worried about how where this is gonna lead to yeah Yeah So you said that you first noticed the anxiety kicking in when about five or six years ago So you would have been about 19. Yeah, and what was happening around that time? I guess I'd finished school about a year before that And I mean I've always been a bit shy at school But it was never ever Like it didn't really affect that things as much as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years I guess it just started when it like my friends went to university and I don't know I felt like I was expected to kind of move out or do something and then it just kind of Escalated from there.
